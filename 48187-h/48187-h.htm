<p class="drop-cap">The housing of the Sovereign is always a matter
of interest to the nation. It were natural to
expect that some definite arrangement should
be made for this purpose, planned and executed
on a grand and appropriate scale. Yet as a matter of
fact this is seldom the case amongst the western nations
of Europe. Two different causes have operated in a
contrary direction. One is the natural predilection of
the ruler of the State for a commodious palace outside,
but not far from, the capital. Thus the great Castle of
Windsor has always been <i>par excellence</i> the favourite
residence of the King of England. The other is the
growth of parliamentary institutions. Thus the entire
space occupied by the original Royal Palace has become
the official meeting-place of the Parliament; and the King
himself has perforce been compelled to find accommodation
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Look at the actual history of the Royal Palace of
<i>Westminster</i>, where the High Court of Parliament now is
accustomed to assemble. It was on this very spot that
Edward the Confessor lived and died, glorying in the
close proximity of the noble abbey that seemed to give
sanctity to his own abode. Here the last Saxon King
entertained Duke William of Normandy, destined to be
his own successor on the throne. Here he gave the
famous feast in which he foretold the failure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
crusades, as Baring Gould records in his delightful
<i>Myths of the Middle Ages</i>. Here Edward I. was born,
and Edward III. died. The great hall was erected by
William Rufus, and the chapel by King Stephen.
Henry VIII. added the star chamber. The painted
chamber, decorated with frescoes by Henry III., was
probably the oldest portion of the mediæval palace, and
just beyond was the prince's chamber with walls
seven feet thick. There was also the ancient Court
of Requests, which served as the House of Lords down
to 1834. The beautiful Gothic Chapel of St. Stephen
was used as the House of Commons from 1547 to
1834. The walls were covered with frescoes representing
scenes from the Old and New Testaments. In modern
times they resounded to the eloquence of Pitt, Fox,
Burke, and Canning.</p>

<p>The curious crypt beneath this chapel was carefully
prepared by H.M. Office of Works for the celebration
of the marriage of Lord Chancellor Loreburn last
December, and a coffin was discovered while making
certain reparations to the stonework, which is believed
to contain the remains of the famous Dr. Lyndwode,
Bishop of St. David's from 1442 to 1446.</p>

<p>In the terrible fire on the night of October 16, 1834,
the entire palace was destroyed with the exception of
the great hall, which, begun by William Rufus, received
its present beautiful roof of chestnut wood from Henry
Yeveley, architect or master mason to Richard II.</p>

<p>The present magnificent Palace of Westminster was
erected by Sir Charles Barry between 1840 and 1859 in
the Gothic style, and is certainly one of the finest modern
buildings in the world. The river front is remarkably
effective, and presents an appearance which at once
arrests the attention of every visitor. It is quite
twice the size of the old palace, formerly occupied by
the King, and cost three millions sterling. It is certainly
the finest modern building in London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span></p>

<p>Some critics have objected to the minuteness of the
decorative designs on the flat surfaces of the walls, but
these are really quite in accord with the delicate genius
of Gothic architecture, and fine examples of this kind of
work are found in Belgium and other parts of the
Continent.</p>

<p>Every one must admit the elegance of proportion
manifested in the architect's design, and this it is which
makes the towers stand out so well above the main
building from every point of view; moreover, this is
the special characteristic which is often so terribly
lacking in modern architecture. One wonders whether
Vitruvius and kindred works receive their due meed of
attention in this twentieth century.</p>

<p>Within the palace the main staircase, with the lobby
and corridors leading to either House of Parliament, are
particularly fine, and form a worthy approach to the
legislative chambers of the vast Empire of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Palace of the <i>Savoy</i> also needs some notice. The
original house was built by Peter, brother of Boniface,
for so many years Archbishop of Canterbury, and uncle
of Eleanor of Provence, wife of King Henry III. By his
will Peter bequeathed this estate to the monks of
Montjoy at Havering-at-Bower, who sold it to Queen
Eleanor, and it became the permanent residence of her
second son Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, and his
descendants. When King John of France was made a
prisoner after the battle of Poitiers in 1356, he was
assigned an apartment in the Savoy, and here he died
on April 9, 1364. The sad event is thus mentioned in
the famous chronicle of Froissart:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The King and Queen, and all the princes of the blood, and all the
nobles of England were exceedingly concerned from the great love and
affection King John had shewn them since the conclusion of peace."</p></div>

<p>The best-known member of the Lancastrian family
who resided in this palace is the famous John of Gaunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
Duke of Lancaster. During his time, so tradition has it,
the well-known poet Chaucer was here married to
Philippa, daughter of Sir Paon de Roet, one of the young
ladies attached to the household of Blanche, Duchess of
Lancaster, and the sister of Catherine Swynford, who at
a later period became the Duke's third wife. However
this may be, the Savoy was at that time the favourite
resort of the nobility of England, and John of Gaunt's
hospitality was unbounded. Stow, in his <i>Chronicle</i>,
declares "there was none other house in the realm to be
compared for beauty and stateliness." Yet how very
transitory is earthly glory, all the pride of place and
power!</p>

<p>In the terrible rebellion of Wat Tyler, in the year
1381, the Savoy was pillaged and burnt, and the Duke
was compelled to flee for his life to the northern parts
of Great Britain. His Grace had become very unpopular
on account of the constant protection he had extended to
the simple followers of Wickcliffe.</p>

<p>After this dire destruction the Savoy was never
restored to its former palatial proportions. The whole
property passed to the Crown, and King Henry VII. rebuilt
it, and by his will endowed it in a liberal manner as a
hospital in honour of St. John the Baptist. This hospital
was suppressed at the Reformation under Edward VI., most
of the estates with which it was endowed passing to the
great City Hospital of St. Thomas. But Queen Mary
refounded the hospital as an almshouse with a master
and other officers, and this latter foundation was finally
dissolved in 1762.</p>

<p>Over the gate, now long destroyed, of King Henry VII.'s
foundation were these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hospitium hoc inopi turbe Savoia vocatum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Septimus Henricus solo fundavit ab imo."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">The Houses of Parliament.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The church, which is the only existing remnant of
former splendour, was built as the chapel of Henry VII.'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
Hospital, and is an interesting example of Perpendicular
architecture, with a curious and picturesque belfry. In
general design it resembles a college chapel, and the
religious services held therein are well maintained. Her
late Majesty Queen Victoria behaved with great
generosity to the church of the Savoy. In her capacity
of Duchess of Lancaster she restored the interior woodwork
and fittings, and after a destructive fire in 1864
effected a second restoration of the entire interior of this
sacred edifice. There is now a rich coloured roof, and
appropriate seats for clergy and people. There is also
preserved a brass belonging to the year 1522 from the
grave of Thomas Halsey, Bishop of Leighlin, and Gavin
Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld, famous in Scottish history
for his piety and learning. There is also a small figure
from Lady Dalhousie's monument, but all the other tombs
perished in the flames in 1864. The history of the
central compartment of the triptych over the font is
curious. It was painted for the Savoy Palace in the
fourteenth century, afterwards lost, and then recovered
in 1876.</p>

<p>Amongst the famous ministers of the Savoy were
Thomas Fuller, author of the <i>Worthies</i>, and Anthony
Horneck. In the Savoy was held the famous conference
between twelve bishops and twelve Nonconformists for
the revision of the Liturgy soon after the accession of
King Charles II. In this conference Richard Baxter took
a prominent part.</p>

<p>In this brief sketch nothing is more remarkable than
the great variety of uses to which the palace of the Savoy
has been put, as well as the gradual decay of mediæval
splendour. Still, however, the name is very familiar to
the multitudes of people who are continually passing up
and down the Strand. Yet it is a far cry to the days of
Archbishop Boniface of Savoy, and Edmund Earl of
Lancaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bridewell</i> is situated on a low-lying strip of land
between the Thames and the Fleet, just westwards of the
south-western end of the Roman wall of London. In
early days this open space only possessed a tower for
defensive purposes, just as the famous Tower of London
guarded the eastern end of the city. Hard by was the
church of St. Bride, founded in the days of the Danes,
most likely in the reign of King Canute, and here there
was a holy well or spring. Hence arose the name of
Bridewell.</p>

<p>In 1087, ancient records relate, King William gave
choice stones from his tower or castle, standing at the
west end of the city, to Maurice, Bishop of London, for
the repair of his cathedral church.</p>

<p>From time to time various rooms were added to the
original structure, which seem chiefly to have been used
for some state ceremonial or judicial purpose. Thus in
the seventh year of King John, Walter de Crisping,
the Justiciar, gave judgment here in an important
lawsuit.</p>

<p>In 1522 the whole building was repaired for the
reception of the famous Emperor Charles V., but that
distinguished Sovereign actually stayed in the Black
Friars, on the other side of the Fleet.</p>

<p>King Henry VIII. made use of Bridewell for the trial
of his famous divorce case. Cardinal Campeggio was
President of the Court, and in the end gave judgment
in favour of Queen Catharine of Aragon. Yet, despite
the Cardinal, Henry would have nothing more to do with
Catharine, and at the same time took a dislike to Bridewell,
which was allowed to fall into decay&mdash;in fact,
nothing of the older building now remains. King
Edward VI., just before his own death in 1553, granted
the charter which converted Bridewell into a charitable
institution, and after many vicissitudes a great work is
still carried on at this establishment for the benefit of
the poor of London. In May, 1552, Dr. Ridley, Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
of London, wrote this striking letter to Sir William
Cecil, Knight, and Secretary to the King:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Good Master Cecyl,&mdash;I must be suitor with you in our Master
Christ's cause. I beseech you be good unto him. The matter is, Sir,
that he hath been too, too long abroad, without lodging, in the streets
of London, both hungry, naked and cold. There is a large wide empty
house of the King's Majesty called Bridewell, which would wonderfully
serve to lodge Christ in, if he might find friends at Court to procure in
his cause."</p></div>

<p>Thus the philanthropic scheme was started, and brought
to completion under the mayoralty of Alderman Sir
George Barnes.</p>

<p><i>St. James's</i> is the most important royal palace of
London. For many a long year it has been most closely
associated with our royal family, and the quaint towers
and gateway looking up St. James's Street possess an
antiquarian interest of quite an unique character. This
palace, moreover, enshrines the memory of a greater
number of famous events in the history of our land than
any other domestic building situated in London, and for
this reason is worthy of special attention.</p>

<p>Its history is as follows:&mdash;Before the Norman
Conquest there was a hospital here dedicated to St. James,
for fourteen maiden lepers. A hospital continued to
exist throughout the middle ages, but when Henry VIII.
became King he obtained this property by an exchange,
and converted it, as Holinshed bears witness, into "a
fair mansion and park" when he was married to Anne
Boleyn. The letters "H. A." can still be traced on the
chimney-piece of the presence chamber or tapestry room,
as well as a few other memorials of those distant days.
And what days they were! Queen Anne Boleyn going
to St. James's in all the joyous splendour of a royal
bride, and how soon afterwards meeting her cruel fate at
the hands of the executioner! Henry VIII. seldom lived
at St. James's Palace, perhaps on account of the weird
reminiscences of Anne Boleyn, but it became the favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
residence of Queen Mary after her husband Philip II.
returned to Spain, and here she died in utter isolation
during the dull November days of the autumn of 1558.
Thus the old palace is first associated with the sad story
of two unhappy queens!</p>

<p>But brighter days were coming. Prince Henry, the
eldest son of James I., settled here in 1610, and kept a
brilliant and magnificent court, attached to which were
nearly 300 salaried officials. Then in two short years
he died, November 6, 1612. Then the palace was given to
Charles, who afterwards ascended the throne in 1625,
and much liked the place as a residence. It is closely
associated with the stirring events of this romantic
monarch's career. Here Charles II., James II., and the
Princess Elizabeth were born, and here Marie de Medici,
the mother of Queen Henrietta Maria, took refuge in 1638,
and maintained a magnificent household for three years.
It is said her pension amounted to £3,000 a month!
Her residence within the royal palace increased the
unpopularity of the King, whose arbitrary treatment of
Parliament led to the ruinous Civil War. The noble
House of Stuart is ever unfortunate all down the long
page of history, and the doleful prognostications of the
Sortes Vergilianæ, sought for by the King, proved but
too true in the event.</p>

<p>We quote six lines of Dryden's translation from the
sixth book of the <i>Æneid</i>, at the page at which the King
by chance opened the book&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Dr. Wellwood says Lord Falkland tried to laugh the
matter off, but the King was pensive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The fortunes of war were against this very attractive
but weak monarch, who was actually brought as a
prisoner of the Parliament from Windsor Castle to his
own Palace of St. James, there to await his trial on a
charge of high treason in Westminster Hall!</p>

<p>Certain of his own subjects presumed to pass sentence
of death upon their own Sovereign, and have become
known to history as the regicides. Very pathetic is the
story of the scenes which took place at St. James's on
Sunday, January 28, 1649. A strong guard of parliamentary
troops escorted King Charles from Whitehall to
St. James's, and Juxon, the faithful Bishop of London,
preached his last sermon to his beloved Sovereign from
the words, "In the day when God shall judge the secrets
of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel." His
Majesty then received the Sacrament, and spent much
time in private devotion. On the morrow he bade farewell
to his dear children the Duke of Gloucester and the
Princess Elizabeth, praying them to forgive his enemies,
and not to grieve, for he was about to die a glorious
death for the maintenance of the laws and liberties of
the land and the true Protestant religion. Then he
took the little Duke of Gloucester on his knees, saying,
"Sweetheart, now they will cut off thy father's head," and
the young prince looked very earnestly and steadfastly
at the King, who bade him be loyal to his brothers
Charles and James, and all the ancient family of Stuart.
And thus they parted.</p>

<p>Afterwards His Majesty was taken from St. James's
to the scaffold at Whitehall. There was enacted the
most tragic scene connected with the entire history of
the Royal Family of England. At the hands of Jacobite
writers the highly-coloured narrative is like to induce
tears of grief, but the Puritans love to dwell on the
King's weaknesses and faults. Yet everyone must needs
acknowledge the calm nobility and unwavering courage
of the King's bearing and conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He nothing common did or mean<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor called the gods with vulgar spite<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The great German historian Leopold von Ranke is
rightly regarded as the best and most impartial authority
on the history of Europe in the seventeenth century. This
is what he says on the martyrdom of Charles I.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The scaffold was erected on the spot where the kings were wont to
show themselves to the people after their coronation. Standing beside
the block at which he was to die, he was allowed once more to speak
in public. He said that the war and its horrors were unjustly laid to his
charge.... If at last he had been willing to give way to arbitrary
power, and the change of the laws by the sword, he would not have
been in this position: he was dying as the martyr of the people, passing
from a perishable kingdom to an imperishable. He died in the faith of
the Church of England, as he had received it from his father. Then
bending to the block, he himself gave the sign for the axe to fall upon
his neck. A moment, and the severed head was shown to the people,
with the words: 'This is the head of a traitor.' All public places, the
crossings of the streets, especially the entrances of the city, were occupied
by soldiery on foot and on horseback. An incalculable multitude had,
however, streamed to the spot. Of the King's words they heard nothing,
but they were aware of their purport through the cautious and guarded
yet positive language of their preachers. When they saw the severed
head, they broke into a cry, universal and involuntary, in which the feelings
of guilt and weakness were blended with terror&mdash;a sort of voice of
nature, whose terrible impression those who heard it were never able to
shake off."</p></div>

<p>These weighty words of Ranke are well worth quoting,
as well as the conclusion of the section of his great
book in which he sums up his estimate of Charles's
claim to the title of martyr:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There was certainly something of a martyr in him, if the man can
be so called who values his own life less than the cause for which he is
fighting, and in perishing himself saves it for the future."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span></p></div>

<p class='center'><i>Published according to Act of Parliament, 1755, for Stow's Survey.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>King Charles I., then, is fairly entitled to be called a
martyr in the calm and unimpassioned judgment of the
greatest historian of modern times in the learned Empire
of Germany, who tests the royal claim by a clear and
concise definition, framed without any regard to the
passionate political feeling which distracted England
in the days of the Stuarts.</p>

<p>And it was in the Palace of St. James that Charles I.
passed the last terrible days of his earthly life.</p>

<p>On the Restoration, King Charles II. resided at
Whitehall, and gave St. James's to his brother James,
Duke of York. Here Queen Mary II. was born, and
here she was married to William of Orange late in the
evening on November 4, 1677. Here also Anne Hyde,
Duchess of York, died in 1671, having lived many years
more or less in seclusion in the old palace.</p>

<p>James afterwards married Mary of Modena as his
second wife, and here was born, on June 10, 1688,
Prince James Edward, better known as the Old Pretender,
whose long life was spent in wandering and exile, in
futile attempts to gain the Crown, in unsuccessful
schemes and ruinous plots, until he and his children
found rest within the peaceful walls of Rome.</p>

<p>Directly after he landed in England, King William III.
came to St. James's, and resided here from time to time
during his possession of the Crown, only towards the
end of his reign allowing the Princess Anne to reside
in this palace, where she first heard of King William's
death. The bearer of the sad news was Dr. Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury.</p>

<p>Immediately on his arrival in England, George I.,
Elector of Hanover, came straight to St. James's just
as King William III. had done. In his <i>Reminiscences</i>,
Walpole gives this quaint anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This is a strange country," remarked the King. "The first morning
after my arrival at St. James's, I looked out of the window, and saw a
park with walks and a canal, which they told me were mine. The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
day Lord Chetwynd, the ranger of my park, sent me a fine brace of
carp out of my canal: and I was told I must give five guineas to Lord
Chetwynd's servant for bringing me my own carp, out of my own canal,
in my own park."</p></div>

<p>Many things seem to have surprised King George I.
in his English dominions, and he really preferred
Hanover, where he died in 1725.</p>

<p>George II. resided at St. James's when Prince of
Wales, and here his beloved wife, Queen Caroline of
Anspach, died on November 20, 1737. Four years
previously her daughter Anne had here been married to
the Prince of Orange. It now became customary to
assign apartments to younger children of the Sovereign
in various parts of the palace, which thus practically
ceased to be in the King's own occupation. The
state apartments are handsome, and contain many
good portraits of royal personages. The Chapel Royal
has a fine ceiling, carved and painted, erected in 1540,
and is constantly used by royalty. George III. hardly
ever missed the Sunday services when in London.</p>

<p>Of course the original palace covered more ground
than is now the case, and included the site of Marlborough
House and some adjacent gardens, now in private ownership.
The German Chapel Royal, which now projects
into the grounds of Marlborough House, was originally
erected by Charles I. for the celebration of Roman Catholic
worship for Queen Henrietta Maria, and at the time gave
great offence to all the nobility and people of the land.</p>

<p>"Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis." Marlborough
House was originally built by Sir Christopher
Wren for the great Duke of Marlborough, on a portion of
St. James's Park given by Queen Anne for that purpose.
Here died the Duke, and his famous Duchess Sarah. The
house was bought by the Crown for the Princess Charlotte
in 1817, and was settled on the Prince of Wales in 1850.
There are still a number of interesting pictures in the
grand salon of the victories of the Duke of Marlborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
by Laguerre. The garden covers the space formerly
occupied by the Great Yard of old St. James's Palace.</p>

<p>Altogether, it is quite clear from the above brief
account that St. James's is the most important of the
royal palaces of London, and more closely connected
than any other with the long history of English Royalty.
From the days of Henry VIII. to the present time
there has always been a close personal connection with
the reigning Sovereign of the British Empire.</p>

<p>The Palace of <i>Whitehall</i> presents a long and strange
history. Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, Chief Minister
of King Henry III., became possessed of the land by
purchase from the monks of Westminster for 140 marks
of silver and the annual tribute of a wax taper. Hubert
bequeathed the property by his will to the Black Friars
of Holborn, who sold it in 1248 to Walter de Grey,
Archbishop of York, for his Grace's town residence.</p>

<p>When Cardinal Wolsey became possessed of the
northern archiepiscopal See, he found York House too
small for his taste, and he set to work to rebuild the
greater part of this palace on a larger and more
magnificent scale. On the completion of the works he
took up his abode here with a household of 800
persons, and lived with more than regal splendour,
from time to time entertaining the King himself to
gorgeous banquets, followed by masked balls. At one
of these grand entertainments they say King Henry first
met Anne Boleyn. A chronicler says the Cardinal was
"sweet as summer to all that sought him."</p>

<p>When the great Cardinal fell into disgrace, and the
Duke of Suffolk came to Whitehall to bid him resign
the Great Seal of England, his Eminence left his palace
by the privy stair and "took barge" to Putney, and
thence to Esher; and Henry VIII. at once took possession
of the vacant property, and began to erect new buildings,
a vast courtyard, tennis court, and picture gallery, and
two great gateways, all of which are now totally destroyed.
It was in this palace that he died, January 28, 1547.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Whitehall was
famous for its magnificent festivities, tournaments, and
receptions of distinguished foreign princes. Especially
was this the case in 1581, when the French commissioners
came to urge the Queen's marriage with the Duke of
Anjou. Here the Queen's corpse lay in state before the
interment in March, 1603. James I. likewise entertained
right royally at Whitehall, and here the Princess Elizabeth
was married to the Elector Palatine on February 14, 1613.
King James also employed that distinguished architect
Inigo Jones to build the beautiful Banqueting House,
which is all that now remains of Whitehall Palace, and
is one of the finest architectural fragments in London.
The proportions are most elegant, and the style perfect.
Used as a chapel till 1890, it is now the United Service
Museum, while the great painter Rubens decorated the
ceiling for Charles I. in 1635.</p>

<p>The whole plan of Inigo Jones remained unfinished,
but Charles I. lived in regal splendour in the palace,
entertaining on the most liberal scale, and forming the
famous collection of pictures dispersed by the Parliament.
Here it was that the masque of Comus was acted before
the King, and other masques from time to time. After
Charles's martyrdom, Oliver Cromwell came to live at
Whitehall, and died there September 3, 1658. On his
restoration, in May, 1660, King Charles II. returned to
Whitehall, and kept his court there in great splendour.
Balls rather than masques were now the fashion, and Pepys
and Evelyn have preserved full descriptions of these elegant
and luxurious festivities, and all the gaiety, frivolity,
and dissoluteness connected with them, and the manner
of life at Charles's court. The King died in the palace
on February 6, 1685, and was succeeded by his austere
brother James, who, during his brief reign, set up a Roman
Catholic chapel within the precincts of the royal habitation,
from which he fled to France in 1688.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">The Palace of Whitehall.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>King William III. preferred other places of residence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
and two fires&mdash;one in 1691, the other in 1698&mdash;destroyed
the greater part of Whitehall, which was never rebuilt.</p>

<p><i>Buckingham</i> Palace is now the principal residence in
London of His Majesty King Edward VII. Though a
fine pile of building it is hardly worthy of its position
as the town residence of the mighty Sovereign of the
greatest Empire of the world, situated in the largest city
on the face of the globe.</p>

<p>King George III. purchased Buckingham Palace in 1761
from Sir Charles Sheffield for £21,000, and in 1775 it was
settled upon Queen Charlotte. In the reign of George IV.
it was rebuilt from designs by Nash; and in 1846, during
the reign of Queen Victoria, the imposing eastern façade
was erected from designs by Blore. The length is 360
feet, and the general effect is striking, though the architectural
details are of little merit. In fact, it is a
discredit to the nation that there is no London palace
for the Sovereign which is worthy of comparison with
the Royal Palace at Madrid, or the Papal Palace in Rome,
though the reason for this peculiar fact is fully set forth
in the historical sketch of the royal palaces already
given. King Edward VII. was born here in 1841, and
here drawing-rooms and levées are usually held. The
white marble staircase is fine, and there are glorious
portraits of Charles I. and Queen Henrietta Maria by
Van Dyck, as well as Queen Victoria and the Prince
Consort by Winterhalter. There is also a full-length
portrait of George IV. by Lawrence in the State dining-room.</p>


<p>In the private apartments there are many interesting
royal portraits, as well as a collection of presents from
foreign princes. There is a lake of five acres in the
gardens, and the whole estate comprises about fifty acres.
There is a curious pavilion adorned with cleverly-painted
scenes from Comus by famous English artists. The view
from the east over St. James's Park towards the India
Office is picturesque, and remarkably countrified for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
heart of a great city. The lake in this park is certainly
very pretty, and well stocked with various water-fowl.
The Horse Guards, Admiralty, and other public offices
at the eastern extremity of this park occupy the old site
of the western side of the Palace of Whitehall.</p>

<p><i>Kensington</i> Palace was the favourite abode of King
William III. He purchased the property from the Earl
of Nottingham, whose father had been Lord Chancellor,
and employed Sir Christopher Wren to add a storey to
the old house, and built anew the present south façade.
Throughout his reign he spent much money in improving
the place, and here his wife, Queen Mary II., died on
December 28, 1694. In the same palace King William
himself breathed his last breath on March 8, 1702.</p>

<p>Queen Anne lived principally at St. James's, the
natural residence for the Sovereigns of Great Britain;
but she took much interest in the proper upkeep of
Kensington, and it was here that her husband died
on October 20, 1708, and herself on August 1, 1714.
Shortly before, she had placed the treasurer's wand in
the hands of the Duke of Shrewsbury, saying, "For
God's sake use it for the good of my people,"
and all the acts of her prosperous reign point to the real
validity of the popular title given by common consent&mdash;the
good Queen Anne.</p>

<p>She planted the trees on "Queen Anne's Mount,"
and gave gorgeous fêtes in the Royal Gardens, whose
woodland scenery possesses a peculiar charm all its own.
The noble groves and avenues of elm trees recall
St. Cloud and St. Germain in the neighbourhood of Paris,
and are quite exceptionally fine. Thus Matthew Arnold
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Here are some of the most poetical bits of tree and stump, and
sunny brown and green glens and tawny earth."</p></div>

<p>George II. died here very suddenly on October 25, 1760,
but the Sovereigns of the House of Hanover chiefly made
use of the place by assigning apartments therein to their
younger children and near relatives. Here it was that
Edward Duke of Kent lived with his wife Victoria of
Saxe-Coburg, and here their only daughter, the renowned
Queen Victoria, was born, May 24, 1819, and here she
resided till her accession to the throne in 1837.</p>

<p>Kensington Palace, then, is chiefly celebrated for its
associations with William III. and Queen Victoria. In
the brief account of the royal palaces here given, it will
be seen that none of the sites, with the exception of
St. James's, remained for any long period of time the
actual residence of the Sovereign, while three&mdash;Westminster,
Bridewell, and the Savoy&mdash;had passed out of
royal hands for residential purposes before the Reformation
of religion was completed. Another curious fact
relates to the origin of the title to these sites, inasmuch
as three of these estates were obtained from some
ecclesiastical corporation, as the Archbishop of York, or
the Hospital of St. James, though Buckingham Palace
was bought from Sir Charles Sheffield, and Kensington
from the Earl of Nottingham.</p>

<p>No account of the palaces of London can be regarded
as complete which omits to mention Lambeth. For more
than 700 years the Archbishops of Canterbury have
resided at this beautiful abode, intensely interesting from
its close association with all the most stirring events in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
the long history of England. The estate was obtained
by Archbishop Baldwin in the year 1197 by exchange
for some lands in Kent with Glanville, Bishop of
Rochester. In Saxon times Goda, the sister of King
Edward the Confessor, had bestowed this property upon
the Bishopric of Rochester; so that it has been continuously
in the hands of the Church for near 900
years. The fine red-brick gateway with white stone
dressings, standing close to the tower of Lambeth Church,
is very imposing as seen from the road, and was built by
Archbishop Cardinal Moreton in 1490. In the Middle
Ages it was the custom to give a farthing loaf twice a
week to the poor of London at this gateway, and as many
as 4,000 were accustomed to partake of the archiepiscopal
gift. Within the gateway is the outer courtyard of the
palace, and at the further end, towards the river Thames,
rises the picturesque Lollard's tower, built between 1434
and 1445 by that famous ecclesiastical statesman
Archbishop Chicheley, founder of All Souls' College,
Oxford. The quaint winding staircase, made of rough
slabs of unplaned oak, is exactly as it was in Chicheley's
time. In this tower is the famous chamber, entirely of
oaken boards, called the Lollards' prison. It is 13 feet
long, 12 feet broad, and 8 feet high, and eight iron rings
remain to which prisoners were fastened. The door has
a lock of wood, fastened with pegs of wood, and may be
a relic of the older palace of Archbishop Sudbury. On
the south side of the outer court stands the hall built
by Archbishop Juxon during the opening years of
Charles II.'s reign, with a fine timber roof, and Juxon's
arms over the door leading into the palace. This Jacobean
hall is now used as the library, and contains many
precious manuscripts of priceless value, including the
<i>Dictyes and Sayings of the Philosophers</i>, translated by
Lord Rivers, in which is found a miniature illumination
of the Earl presenting Caxton on his knees to Edward IV.,
who is supported by Elizabeth Woodville and her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
Edward V. This manuscript contains the only known
portrait of the latter monarch.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">St. James's Palace, from Pall Mall and from the Park.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>An earlier hall had been built on the same site by
Archbishop Boniface in 1244.</p>

<p>From the library we pass by a flight of stairs to the
guard room, now used as the dining hall. The chief
feature is the excellent series of oil portraits of the
occupants of the primatial See of Canterbury, beginning
in the year 1504. The mere mention of the principal
names recalls prominent events in our national history.</p>

<p>There is Warham painted by Holbein. He was also
Lord Chancellor, and the last of the mediæval episcopate.
There is Cranmer, burnt at Oxford, March 21, 1555.
There is Cardinal Pole, the cousin and favourite of Queen
Mary. There is Matthew Parker, the friend of Queen
Elizabeth, well skilled in learning and a great collector
of manuscripts, now for the most part in the library of
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. There is William
Laud, painted by Van Dyck, the favourite Counsellor and
Adviser of Charles I. At the age of 71 he was beheaded
by order of the House of Commons&mdash;an act of vengeance,
not of justice. There is William Juxon, who stood by
Charles I. on the scaffold, and heard the ill-fated King
utter his last word on earth, "Remember." But we
cannot even briefly recount all the famous portraits to be
found at Lambeth. The above selection must suffice.</p>

<p>The chapel, also, is a building of singular interest.
Beneath is an ancient crypt said to have been erected by
Archbishop Herbert Fitzwalter, while the chapel itself
was built by Archbishop Boniface of Savoy between 1249
and 1270. The lancet windows are elegant, and were
filled with stained glass by Archbishop Laud, all of which
was duly broken to pieces during the Commonwealth.
The supposed Popish character of this glass was made an
article of impeachment against Laud at the trial at which
he was sentenced to death. Here the majority of the
archbishops have been consecrated since the reign of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
Henry III. Archbishop Parker was both consecrated
and also buried in the chapel, but his tomb was desecrated
and his bones scattered by Scot and Hardyng, who
possessed the palace under Oliver Cromwell. On the
restoration they were re-interred by Sir William Dugdale.
At the west end is a beautiful Gothic confessional, high
up on the wall, erected by Archbishop Chicheley. Archbishop
Laud presented the screen, and Archbishop Tait
restored the whole of this sacred edifice, which measures
12 feet by 25 feet. Formerly the archbishops lived in
great state. Thus, Cranmer's household comprised a
treasurer, comptroller, steward, garnator, clerk of the
kitchen, caterer, clerk of the spicery, yeoman of the
ewery, bakers, pantlers, yeoman of the horse, yeoman
ushers, besides numerous other less important officials.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pole possessed a patent from Queen Mary,
authorising a household of 100 servants. The modern
part of the palace was built by Archbishop Howley in
the Tudor style. He held the See from 1828 to 1848,
and was the last prelate to maintain the archiepiscopal
state of the olden time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ELIZABETHAN_LONDON" id="ELIZABETHAN_LONDON">ELIZABETHAN LONDON</a></h2>

<p class='p3'><span class="smcap">By T. Fairman Ordish, F.S.A.</span></p>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.png" width="100" height="118" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The leading feature of Elizabethan London was
that it was a great port. William Camden,
writing in his <i>Britannia</i>, remarked that the
Thames, by its safe and deep channel, was
able to entertain the greatest ships in existence, daily
bringing in so great riches from all parts "that it
striveth at this day with the Mart-townes of Christendome
for the second prise, and affoordeth a most sure and
beautiful Roade for shipping" (Holland's translation).
Below the great bridge, one of the wonders of Europe,
we see this shipping crowding the river in the maps
and views of London belonging to the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. The Tower and the bridge were the city's
defences against attack by water. Near the Tower was
the Custom House, where peaceful commerce paid its
dues; and between the Custom House and the bridge
was the great wharf of Billingsgate, where goods were
landed for distribution. Near the centre of the bridge
was a drawbridge, which admitted vessels to another
great wharf, Queenhithe, at a point midway between
London Bridge and Blackfriars. Between the bridge
and Queenhithe was the Steelyard, the domain of the
merchants of the Hanseatic League. Along the river
front were numerous other wharves, where barges and
lighters unloaded goods which they brought from the
ships in the road, or from the upper reaches of the
Thames. For the river was the great highway of London.
It answered the needs of commerce, and it furnished the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
chief means of transit. The passenger traffic of
Elizabethan London was carried on principally by means
of rowing-boats. A passenger landed at the point
nearest to his destination, and then walked; or a servant
waited for him with a saddle-horse. The streets were too
narrow for coaches, except in two or three main arteries.</p>

<p>The characteristic of present-day London, at which
all foreigners most marvel, is the amount of traffic in
the streets. In Elizabethan London this characteristic
existed in the chief highway&mdash;the Thames. The
passenger-boats were generally described as "wherries,"
and they were likened by Elizabethan travellers to the
gondolas of Venice; for instance, by Coryat, in his
<i>Crudities</i>, who thought the playhouses of Venice very
beggarly compared with those of London, but admired
the gondoliers, because they were "altogether as swift
as our rowers about London." The maps of the period
reveal the extraordinary number of "stairs" for landing
passengers along both banks of the river, besides the
numerous wharves for goods. John Stow, the author of
the <i>Survey of London</i>, published first in 1598, and again
in a second edition in 1603, describes the traffic on the
river. "By the Thames," he says, "all kinds of
merchandise be easily conveyed to London, the principal
storehouse and staple of all commodities within this
realm. So that, omitting to speak of great ships and
other vessels of burthen, there pertaineth to the cities
of London, Westminster, and borough of Southwark,
above the number, as is supposed, of 2,000 wherries and
other small boats, whereby 3,000 poor men at the least
be set on work and maintained." Many of these
watermen were old sailors, who had sailed and fought
under Drake. The Armada deliverance was recalled by
Drake's ship, which lay in the river below the bridge.
The voyage of the Earl of Essex to Spain, the
expeditions to Ireland and to the Low Countries, formed
the staple of the gossip of these old sailors who found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
employment in the chief means of locomotion in
Elizabethan London.</p>

<p>There was only the single bridge, but there were
several ferries. The principal ferry was from Blackfriars
and the Fleet river to a point opposite on the Surrey
side, called Paris Garden stairs&mdash;nearly in a line with
the present Blackfriars Bridge. At Westminster was
another, from the Horseferry Road to a point a little west
of Lambeth Palace&mdash;almost in the line of the present
Lambeth Bridge. The river was fordable at low tide
at this point; horses crossed here&mdash;whence the name
Horseferry&mdash;and possibly other cattle, when the tide was
unusually low.</p>

<p>The sea is the home of piety. Coast towns, ports,
and havens, reached after voyages of peril, are invariably
notable for their places of worship, and for customs
which speak touchingly&mdash;like the blessing of fishermen's
nets, for instance&mdash;of lives spent in uncertainty and
danger. Thus, the leading characteristic of Elizabethan
London being its association with the sea and its
dependence on the river, we find that its next most
striking characteristic was the extraordinary number of
churches it contained. The great cathedral predominated
more pronouncedly than its modern successor. From the
hill on which it was based it reared its vast bulk; its
great spire ascended the heavens, and the multitude of
church towers and spires and belfries throughout the
city seemed to follow it. The houses were small, the
streets were narrow; but to envisage the city from the
river, or from the Surrey side, was to have the eye
led upwards from point to point to the summit of
St. Paul's. The dignity and piety of London were thus
expressed, in contradiction to human foibles and failings
so conspicuous in Elizabethan drama. The spire of
St. Paul's was destroyed by lightning early in the reign
of Elizabeth; and the historian may see much significance
in the fact that it was not rebuilt, even in thanksgiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
and praise for the deliverance from the Great Armada.
The piety of London dwindled until it flamed forth
anew in the time of the Puritan revolt.</p>

<p>The bridge was carried on nineteen arches. It had
a defensive gate at the Southwark end, and another
gateway at the northern end. In the centre was a
beautiful chapel, dedicated to Thomas à Becket, and
known as St. Thomas of the Bridge. Houses were built
on the bridge, mostly shops with overhanging signs,
as in the streets of the city. Booksellers and
haberdashers predominated, but other trades were carried
on also. After the chapel, the most conspicuous feature
of the bridge was "Nonesuch House," so called to express
the wonder that it was constructed in Holland entirely
of wood, brought over the water piece by piece, and
put together on the bridge by dovetailing and pegs,
without the use of a single metal nail. Adjoining the
northern gateway was an engine for raising water by
means of a great wheel operated by the tide. Near
the Southwark end were corn-mills, worked on the same
principle, below the last two arches of the bridge. The
gateway at the Southwark end, so well shown in Visscher's
view of London, was finished in 1579, and the traitors'
heads, which formerly surmounted a tower by the
drawbridge, were transferred to it. Travellers from the
south received this grim salutation as they approached
the bridge, which led into the city; and when they
glanced across the river, the Tower frowned upon them,
and the Traitors' Gateway, like teeth in an open mouth,
deepened the effect of warning and menace.</p>

<p>But these terrors loomed darkling in the background
for the most part. They belonged rather to the time
when the sovereign's palaces at Westminster and at the
Tower seemed to hold London in a grip. The palace
at Westminster now languished in desuetude; the Tower
was a State prison, and&mdash;with some ironical intent,
perhaps&mdash;also the abode of the royal beasts, lions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
tigers, leopards, and other captives. The Queen passed
in her royal barge down the river with ceremonious
pageantry from her palace of Whitehall; the drawbridge
raised, the floating court passed the Tower as with lofty
indifference on its way to "Placentia," Her Majesty's
palace at Greenwich. Out of the silence of history a
record speaks like a voice, and tells us that here, in
1594, Shakespeare and his fellows performed at least
two comedies or interludes before Her Majesty, and we
know even the amounts that were paid them for their
services.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">Plan of London in the time of Queen Elizabeth (1563).</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Survey</i> of John Stow we have three separable
elements: the archæology and history of London, Stow's
youthful recollections of London in the time of Henry
the Eighth, and Stow's description of the great change
which came over London after the dissolution of the
religious houses, and continued in process throughout
his lifetime. The mediæval conditions were not remote.
He could remember when London was clearly defined
by the wall, like a girdle, of which the Tower was the
knot. No heroic change had befallen; the wall had
not been cast down into its accompanying fosse to form
a ring-street, as was done when Vienna was transformed
from the mediæval state. London had simply filled
up the ditch with its refuse; its buildings had simply
swarmed over the wall and across the dike; shapeless
and haphazard suburbs had grown up, till the surrounding
villages became connected with the city. Even more
grievous, in the estimation of Stow, was the change which
he had witnessed within the city itself. The feudal lords
had departed, and built themselves mansions outside
the city. The precincts of the dissolved religious
establishments had been converted into residential
quarters, and a large proportion of the old monastic
gardens had been built upon. The outlines of society had
become blurred. Formerly, the noble, the priest, and
the citizen were the defined social strata. Around each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
of these was grouped the rest of the social units in
positions of dependence. A new type of denizen had
arisen, belonging to none of the old categories&mdash;the
typical Elizabethan Londoner.</p>

<p>The outward aspect of Elizabethan London reflected
this social change. On the south of the city, along the
line of Thames Street, the wall had entirely disappeared.
On the east and west it was in decay, and was becoming
absorbed in fresh buildings. Only on the north side of
the city, where it had been re-edified as late as 1474, did
the wall suggest its uses for defence. In the map of
Agas, executed early in the reign of Elizabeth, this
portion of the wall, with its defensive towers and bastions,
appears singularly well preserved. Thus the condition of
the wall suggested the passing of the old and the coming
of the new order. The gates which formerly defended
the city, where the chief roadways pierced the wall,
still remained as monuments, and they were admirably
adapted to the purpose of civic pageantry and ceremonial
shows. Indeed, the gateway on the Oxford road was
rebuilt in 1586, and called Newgate, "from the newness
thereof," and it was the "fairest" of all the gates of
London. It is reckoned that this was the year that
Shakespeare came to London from Stratford-on-Avon;
and the assumption is generally allowed that he entered
the city by Newgate, which would be his direct road.
A new gate, of an artistic and ornamental character,
set in the ancient wall, was a sign and a symbol of
the new conditions in London, of which Shakespeare
himself was destined to become the chief result.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>With the characteristics of London as a great mart
and port is included the foreign elements in its
population. In Lombard Street the merchants of
Lombardy from early mediæval times had performed
the operations of banking and foreign exchange; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
around them were assembled the English merchants of
all qualities and degrees. Business was conducted in
the open street, and merchants merely adjourned into
the adjoining houses to seal their bonds and make their
formal settlements. Henry VIII. tried to induce the
city to make use of the great building of Leadenhall
for this purpose; but the innovation was resisted, and
Lombard Street continued to be the burse of London
till long after the accession of Elizabeth. The name
of Galley Key remained in Tower Street ward to mark
the spot on the river bank "where the galleys of
Italy and other parts did discharge their wines and
merchandises brought to this city." The men of the
galleys lived as a colony by themselves in Mincing Lane;
the street leading to their purlieus was called,
indifferently, Galley Row and Petit Wales. Here was
a great house, the official territorium of the Principality.
The original of Shakespeare's "Fluellen" may very
possibly have been a denizen of this quarter.</p>

<p>Above the bridge, in Thames Street, was the
territorium of the Hanse merchants, alluded to by Stow
as "the merchants of Almaine," and by Camden as
"the Easterlings or Dutch merchants of the Steelyard."
Their position in the city was one of great importance:
the export trade of the country in woollen goods was
chiefly in their hands, and they had their own Guildhall
in Upper Thames Street, called the <i>Gilda Teutonicorum</i>.
The special privileges accorded to this foreign
commercial community carried the obligation to maintain
Bishopsgate in repair, and "to defend it at all times
of danger and extremity." When the house of the
Augustine Friars, Old Broad Street, was dissolved, and
its extensive gardens became cut up and built upon, the
Dutch colony settled there in residence, and the church
of Austin Friars was specially assigned to them by
Edward VI. Towards the end of the reign of Elizabeth
the privileges of the Hanse merchants were revoked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
and their guildhall was confiscated to the use of the
navy. But the Dutch element continued as a part of
the commercial life of the city, and the church of Austin
Friars is still the "church of the Dutch nation in London."</p>

<p>West of the Steelyard was the Vintry. Here the
merchants of Bordeaux had been licensed to build their
warehouses of stone, at the rear of a great wharf, on
which were erected cranes for unloading the lighters
and other boats which brought the casks from the ships
below bridge. The trade of these foreign merchants
gave the name of Vintry Ward to one of the divisions
of the city. In Bishopsgate Ward, near the church of
St. Botolph, was a French colony, their purlieus forming
a quadrant, called Petty France.</p>

<p>Elizabethan London was more cosmopolitan than
many European capitals. In Lombard Street the
merchants of Germany, France, and Italy were
conspicuously differentiated by the varieties of costume.
On the site of the present Royal Exchange, Sir Thomas
Gresham laid the first stone of his great Bourse in 1566;
the design was in imitation of the Bourse at Antwerp;
the materials of its construction were imported from
Flanders; the architect and builder was a Fleming,
named Henryke. The opening of this building by Queen
Elizabeth in state in January, 1571, when Her Majesty
commanded it to be proclaimed by herald and trumpet
that the Bourse should be called The Royal Exchange
from that time henceforth, is a familiar story, because
it is, in fact, one of the most striking and significant
events in the history of London. The trumpet of that
herald, on January 23rd, 1571, announced a new era.</p>


<p>The building was a quadrangle, enclosing an open
space. The sides formed a cloister or sheltered walk;
above this was a corridor, or walk, called "the pawn,"
with stalls or shops, like the Burlington Arcade of the
present day; above this again was a tier of rooms.
The great bell-tower stood on the Cornhill front; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
bell was rung at noon and at six in the evening. On
the north side, looking towards St. Margaret's, Lothbury,
was a tall Corinthian column. Both tower and column
were surmounted by a grasshopper&mdash;the Gresham crest.
The inscription on the façade of the building was in
French, German, and Italian. The motley scene of
Lombard Street had been transferred to the Royal
Exchange. The merchants of Amsterdam, of Antwerp,
of Hamburg, of Paris, of Bordeaux, of Venice and
Vienna, distinguishable to the eye by the dress of the
nations they represented, and to the ear by the differences
of language, conducted their exchanges with English
merchants, and with each other, in this replica of the
Bourse of Antwerp, the rialto of Elizabethan London.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Cheapside was called West Cheap in Elizabethan
London, in contradistinction to East Cheap, famous for
ever as the scene of the humours of "Dame Quickly"
and "Falstaff." The change in West Cheap since the
mediæval period was chiefly at the eastern end, on the
north side. Here a large space opposite the church of
St. Mary-le-Bow was formerly kept clear of building,
although booths and stalls for market purposes occupied
the ground temporarily. The space was otherwise
reserved for the mediæval jousts, tournaments, and other
civic pageantry. The site of Mercers' Hall was occupied
by the <i>Militia Hospitalis</i>, called, after Thomas à Becket,
St. Thomas of Acon. After the Dissolution this
establishment was granted by Henry to the Mercers'
Company, who adapted the existing buildings to the
purposes of their hall, one of the principal features of
Cheap in Elizabethan times. The district eastward of
Mercers' Hall had become filled up with building, and
the making of Cheap as a thoroughfare was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
complete. The original road westward was from the
top of New Fish Street, by East Cheap, Candlewick
or Cannon Street, past London Stone (probably the
Roman <i>Milliarium</i>), along Budge Row and Watling
Street, to the site of St. Paul's, where it is conjectured
a temple of Diana stood in Roman times. But Cheap,
or West Cheap, was the chief traffic way westward in
Elizabethan London; it was filled with shops and
warehouses, a thriving business centre, the pride of the
city. The name of "Cheap" was derived from the
market, and several of the streets leading into it yet
bear names which in Elizabethan times were descriptive
of the trades there carried on. Thus the Poultry was
the poulterers' market; ironmongers had their shops in
Ironmonger Lane, as formerly they had their stalls in
the same area; in Milk Street were the dairies; and
towards the west end of Cheap was Bread Street, the
market of the bakers, and Friday Street, where
fishmongers predominated. Lying between these two
streets, with frontages in both, was the Mermaid Tavern,
the chief resort of "the breed of excellent and choice
wits," included by Camden among the glories of
Elizabethan London. Stow does not refer to the
Mermaid by name, but possibly he had it in mind when
he wrote the following passage: "Bread Street, so called
of bread sold there, as I said, is now wholly inhabited
by rich merchants; and divers fair inns be there, for
good receipt of carriers and other travellers to the
city." The trades kept themselves in their special
localities, although they did not always give the name
to the street they occupied. Thus, to return to the
eastern end of Cheap, there was Bucklersbury, where
the pepperers or grocers were located, having given up
their former quarters in Sopars' Lane to the cordwainers
and curriers. With the grocers were mingled apothecaries
and herbalists; and hence the protest of Falstaff, in
the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, that he was not "like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklesbury in
simple time." In the midst of Cheap, at a point between
Mercers' Hall and Old Jewry, opposite the end of
Bucklersbury, was the water conduit&mdash;in the words of
Stow, "The great conduit of sweet water, conveyed
by pipes of lead underground from Paddington for
the service of this city, castellated with stone, and
cisterned in lead." Around the conduit stood the great
jars used by the water-carriers to convey the water to
the houses. The water-carrier, as a type of Elizabethan
London, is preserved by Ben Jonson in the character
of Cob in <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>. Going westward
from the Conduit, another object stood out in the
roadway&mdash;the Standard, a tall pillar at which the public
executions of the city jurisdiction took place. Still
further west, in the midst of Cheap, stood the Eleanor
Cross, one of the most beautiful monuments in London
at this time.</p>

<p>The Guildhall stood where it stands to-day, accessible
from Cheap by Ironmonger Lane and St. Lawrence Lane.
Only the walls and the crypt of the original building
remain; but the features of this great civic establishment,
as well as its sumptuous character and beautiful
adornments, were practically the same in the days of
Gresham as at the present time. Stow describes the
stately porch entering the great hall, the paving of
Purbeck marble, the coloured glass windows, and, alas!
the library which had been "borrowed" by the Protector
Somerset in the preceding reign. Near the Guildhall
was the church of St. Mary Aldermanbury, the
predecessor of the existing edifice. In this parish dwelt
Hemmings and Condell, "fellows" of Shakespeare&mdash;that
is to say, players of his company, whom he remembered
in his will. These men conferred a benefit on all
future ages by collecting the poet's plays, seven years
after his death, and publishing them in that folio edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
which is one of the most treasured volumes in the
world. In the churchyard a monument to their
memory was erected in 1896. It is surmounted by a bust
of the poet, who looks forth serenely greeting the
passer-by from beneath the shade of trees in this quiet
old churchyard in modern London.</p>

<p>To return to Cheap, it remains to speak of a feature
which attracted Queen Elizabeth, and was, indeed, one
of the marvels of London. Here are the <i>ipsissima verba</i>
of Stow's contemporary description:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Next to be noted, the most beautiful frame of fair houses and shops that
be within the walls of London, or elsewhere in England, commonly called
Goldsmiths' Row, betwixt Bread Street end and the cross in Cheap ...
the same was built by Thomas Wood, goldsmith, one of the sheriffs of London,
in the year 1491. It containeth in number ten fair dwelling-houses and
fourteen shops, all in one frame, uniformly built four stories high, beautified
towards the street with the Goldsmiths' arms and the likeness of woodmen, in
memory of his name, riding on monstrous beasts, all which is cast in lead,
richly painted over and gilt. These he gave to the goldsmiths, with stocks of
money, to be lent to young men having those shops. This said front was
again new painted and gilt over in the year 1594; Sir Richard Martin being
then mayor, and keeping his mayoralty in one of them."</p></div>

<p>Beyond Goldsmiths' Row was the old Change; the
name and the street both still exist. Beyond old Change
were seven shops; then St. Augustine's Gate, leading
into St. Paul's Churchyard; and then came Paternoster
Row. Between Paternoster Row and Newgate Street
stood the Church of St. Michael-le-Querne, stretching
out into the middle of Cheap, where the statue of
Sir Robert Peel now stands. Stretching out from the
east end of the church, still further into the street, was
a water conduit, which supplied all the neighbourhood
hereabout, called "The Little Conduit," not because it
was little, but to distinguish it from the great conduit
at the other end of Cheap.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are concerned in this place not with the history of
old St. Paul's, nor with the technique of its architecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
but with the great cathedral as a religious and social
institution, the centre of Elizabethan London. Here the
streams of life were gathered, and hence they radiated.
It was the official place of worship of the Corporation;
the merchants of the city followed. The monarch on
special occasions attended the services; the nobility
followed the royal example. The typical Elizabethan
made the middle aisle his promenade, where he displayed
the finery of his attire and the elegance of his deportment.
The satirists found a grand opportunity in the humours
of Paul's Walk; but the effect of the cathedral is not
to be derived from such allusions in the literature of
the time. All classes were attracted by the beautiful
organ and the anthems so exquisitely sung by the choir.
The impressive size and noble proportions of the building,
the soaring height of the nave, the mystery of the open
tower, where the ascending vision became lost in gathering
obscurity, and where the chords from the organ died
away; these spiritual associations, these appeals to the
imagination, were uplifting influences so powerful that
the vanities of Paul's Walk were negligible by
comparison. As with the gargoyle on the outer walls,
the prevailing effect was so sublime, that it was merely
heightened by this element of the grotesque.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The cathedral stood in the midst of a churchyard.
In the mediæval period this was enclosed by a wall.
In the reign of Elizabeth the wall still existed, but, as
Stow observes, "Now on both sides, to wit, within and
without, it be hidden with dwelling-houses." In 1561
the great steeple was struck by lightning and destroyed
by fire, but the tower from which the spire arose remained.
The tower was 260 feet high, and the height of the spire
was the same, so that the pinnacle was 520 feet from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
base.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Surmounting the pinnacle, in this earlier portion
of Elizabeth's reign, was a weathercock, an object of
curiosity to which Stow devotes a minute description.
In the midst of the churchyard stood Paul's Cross&mdash;"a
pulpit cross of timber, mounted upon steps of stone
and covered with lead, in which are sermons preached
every Sunday in the forenoon." Many of the monastic
features of the establishment had disappeared; others
were transformed and adapted to other uses. The
great central fabric remained, and the school flourished&mdash;"Paul's
School," in the east part of the churchyard,
endowed by Dean Colet in 1512, and rebuilt in the
later years of Elizabeth, where one hundred and
fifty-three poor men's children were given a free education
under a master, an usher, and a chaplain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Newgate Street, Cheapside, Cornhill, Leadenhall, and
Aldgate formed (as they do still) nearly a straight line,
east and west. From this line to the wall on the north,
in Plantagenet and early Tudor times, the city was largely
composed of open spaces: chiefly the domains of religious
houses; while south of the dividing line to the river the
ground was thickly built over. After the Dissolution the
transformation of the northern area began.</p>

<p>Considerable building took place in the reign of
Edward VI.; but at the time of Elizabeth's accession the
generally open character of this area, as compared with
the more southerly part of the city, still subsisted. The
increase of population, however, due very largely to people
who flocked to London from all parts of the country, led
to rapid building, which produced the Queen's famous
proclamation to stay its further progress. To evade the
ordinance, and to meet the ever-increasing demand, large
houses were converted into tenements, and a vast number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
of people were thus accommodated who lived chiefly out-of-doors
and took their meals in the taverns, inns, and
ordinaries which abounded in all parts of the city. The
pressure of demand continued, and the open spaces
became gradually built over. The Queen and her
government, aghast at the incessant tide of increase, in
terror of the plague, recognised the futility of further
prohibition, and avoided communication with the city as
much as possible. At the slightest hint of plague
Her Majesty would start off on one of her Progresses, or
betake herself to Richmond, to Hampton Court, or to
Greenwich.</p>

<p>Some of these transformations of ancient monastic
purlieus may be briefly instanced. Within Newgate was
the house and precinct of the Grey Friars. After the
Dissolution the whole precinct was presented by Henry
to the citizens of London, and here Edward VI. founded
the school for poor fatherless children, which became
famous as Christ's Hospital, "the Bluecoat school."</p>

<p>Let a short passage from Stow describe this change
from the old order to the new:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the year 1552 began the repairing of the Greyfriars house for
the poor fatherless children; and in the month of November the
children were taken into the same, to the number of almost four
hundred. On Christmas Day, in the afternoon, while the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen rode to Paules, the children of Christ's Hospital stood from
St. Lawrence Lane end in Cheape towards Paules, all in one livery of
russet cotton, three hundred and forty in number; and in Easter next,
they were in blue at the Spittle, and so have continued ever since."</p></div>

<p>The Greyfriars or Bluecoat school was one of the
largest buildings in London. Its demesne extended to the
city wall, in which there was a gate communicating with
the grounds of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the famous
foundation of Rahere. The wall ran northward from the
New Gate, the ground between the school and the wall
on that side had been built over. There was a continuous
line of building along Newgate Street to St. Martin's le
Grand. The shambles or meat market occupied the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
of the street, called St. Nicholas Shambles, from a church
which had been demolished since the Reformation.</p>

<p>From Newgate Street and the top of Cheapside to
St. Anne's Lane was formerly the territory of the Collegiate
Church and Sanctuary of St. Martin's le Grand. The
college was dismantled after the edict of dissolution, but
the sanctuary remained.</p>

<p>Some of the collegiate buildings had been converted
into tenements, and other houses had been erected. These
were occupied by "strangers born"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, denizens who
were not born Londoners&mdash;although within the walls the
civic jurisdiction did not extend over this territory.
Certain trades were carried on here outside the regulated
industry of the city&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, tailoring and lace-making. The
district became one of the resorts of the Elizabethan
ruffler; and under the ægis of the ancient right of
sanctuary a kind of Alsatia came into existence, the scene
of many exciting episodes when debtors and fugitives from
justice evaded their pursuers, and succeeded in reaching
these precincts.</p>

<p>In Broad Street the ancient glory of the Augustine
Friars was still a memory, and much of their spacious
domain had been divided into gardens. The beautiful
church remained, but the spire was becoming ruinous from
neglect. Stow described the gardens, the gates of the
precinct, and the great house which had been built here by
William Paulet, first Marquis of Winchester, Lord
Treasurer of England, "in place of Augustine friar's house,
cloister, gardens, etc." There is an admirable irony in the
recital of Stow at this point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The friars church he pulled not down, but the west end thereof,
inclosed from the steeple and choir, was in the year 1550 granted to the
Dutch nation in London, to be their preaching place: the other part&mdash;namely,
the steeple, choir, and side aisles to the choir adjoining&mdash;he
reserved to household uses, as for stowage of corn, coal and other things;
his son and heir, Marquis of Winchester, sold the monuments of noblemen
there buried in great number, the paving stone and whatsoever (which cost
many thousands) for one hundred pounds, and in place thereof made fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
stabling for horses. He caused the lead to be taken from the roofs, and
laid tile in place thereof; which exchange proved not so profitable as he
looked for, but rather to his disadvantage."</p></div>

<p>Between Broad Street and Bishopsgate Street the space
was chiefly composed of gardens. One of the houses
fronting Bishopsgate Street was the residence of Sir
Thomas Gresham (perhaps his house in Lombard Street
was reserved for business purposes).</p>

<p>On the opposite side of Bishopsgate Street was Crosby
Hall and the precinct of the dissolved nunnery of St.
Helen, extending towards St. Mary Axe and the church
of St. Andrew Undershaft. At the further end of St.
Mary Axe was the "Papye," a building which had been a
hospital for poor priests before the Reformation. In the
year 1598 Shakespeare was living in the St. Helen's
precinct, within the shadow of Crosby Hall, and John
Stow, in his home near the church of St. Andrew
Undershaft, had just corrected the proofs of the first edition
of his <i>Survey of London</i>. Stow tells us about Gresham's
House and about Crosby Hall. He tells us that Sir
Francis Walsingham, the Secretary of State, resided at
the Papye. He describes the church of St. Andrew
Undershaft, where his own monument may be seen at the
present day; he describes, too, the ancient church of the
nunnery of St. Helen, in which a memorial window now
commemorates Shakespeare. But he failed to mention
the fact, which has since been recovered from the
subsidy-roll in the Record Office, that William Shakespeare
was a denizen of the precinct in 1598. Had Shakespeare
built a water conduit in the neighbourhood, or endowed
an almshouse, he might have been celebrated in the pages
of John Stow.</p>

<p>They were neighbours, and may have been acquainted.
The district had been familiar to Stow from childhood,
and he may have entertained the poet as he entertains
us in his <i>Survey</i> with recollections of the changes he
had witnessed in his long lifetime. Describing Tower Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
he recalls the abbey of nuns of the order of St. Clare,
called the Minories, and after giving the facts of its history,
proceeds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In place of this house of nuns is now built divers fair and large
storehouses for armour and habiliments of war, with divers workhouses
serving to the same purpose: there is a small parish church for inhabitants
of the close, called St. Trinities. Near adjoining to this abbey, on the
south side thereof, was sometime a farm belonging to the said nunnery;
at the which farm I, myself, in my youth, have fetched many a half-penny
worth of milk, and never had less than three ale pints for a
half-penny in the summer, nor less than one ale quart for a half-penny in
the winter, always hot from the kine, as the same was milked and
strained. One Trolop, and afterwards Goodman, were the farmers there,
and had thirty or forty kine to the pail. Goodman's son being heir to
his father's purchase, let out the ground, first for grazing of horses, and
then for garden-plots, and lived like a gentleman thereby."</p></div>

<p>Here we have the source of the name Goodman's Fields,
a point of some interest for us; but how vastly more
interesting to have rambled with Stow in Elizabethan
London, listening to such stories of the old order which
had passed, giving place to the new!</p>

<p>We have strayed outside the wall, but not far. This
road between Aldgate and the Postern Gate by the Tower,
running parallel with the wall, is called the Minories,
after the nunnery. Setting our faces towards Aldgate, to
retrace our steps, we have the store-houses for armour and
habiliments of war on our right; the wide ditch on our
left has been filled up, and partly enclosed for cultivation.
There are trees, and cows browsing, although the farm
which Stow remembered no longer existed. Before us,
just outside Aldgate, is the church of St. Buttolph, with
its massive tower, standing in a spacious churchyard.
Owing to the extensive building and development which
had taken place outside the wall since the Reformation, it
had been necessary to construct lofts and galleries in this
church to accommodate the parishioners. At Aldgate
the line of the wall turns westward towards Bishopsgate.
Parallel to it a road has been made along the bank of
the ditch, and leads into Bishopsgate Street. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
Houndsditch. The houses stand thickly along one side of
the way looking towards the wall; the ditch has been filled
up, and the wide surface is used for cattle pens or milking
stalls.</p>

<p>We will not go along Houndsditch, but turning sharply
to the left from St. Buttolph's we pass through Aldgate.
In doing so we immediately find ourselves in the midst of
the remains of the great priory of Holy Trinity. The
road leads southward into Fenchurch Street, branching off
on the west into Leadenhall Street. At the junction of
these streets stood the hospitium of the priory. Between
Leadenhall Street and the city wall, from Aldgate nearly
up to St. Andrew Undershaft, lies the ground-plan of
the establishment of the Canons Regular, known as
Christchurch, or the priory of Holy Trinity, the grandest
of all the monastic institutions in Middlesex except
Westminster. The heads of the establishment were
aldermen of the City of London, representing the Portsoken
Ward.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"These priors have sitten and ridden amongst the aldermen of
London, in livery like unto them, saving that his habit was in shape of a
spiritual person, as I, myself, have seen in my childhood; at which
time the prior kept a most bountiful house of meat and drink, both
for rich and poor, as well within the house as at the gates, to all
comers, according to their estates" (Stow).</p></div>

<p>In 1531 the King took possession of Christchurch;
the canons were sent to other houses of the same order&mdash;St.
Bartholomew the Great, Smithfield; St. Mary Overies,
Southwark; and St. Mary Spital&mdash;"and the priory, with
the appurtenances, King Henry gave to Sir Thomas
Audley, newly knighted, and after made Lord Chancellor"
(Stow). So extensive and so solid was the mass of building
that Audley was at a loss to get the space cleared for the
new house he wished to build here. He offered the great
church of the priory to any one who would take it down
and cart away the materials. But as this offer met with no
response, Audley had to undertake the destruction himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
Stow could remember how the workmen employed on this
work, "with great labour, beginning at the top"&mdash;the
tower had pinnacles at each corner like the towers at
St. Saviour's and St. Sepulchre's&mdash;"loosed stone from stone,
and threw them down, whereby the most part of them were
broken, and few remained whole; and those were sold very
cheap, for all the buildings then made about the city were
of brick and timber. At that time any man in the city
might have a cart-load of hard stone for paving brought to
his door for sixpence or sevenpence, with the carriage."
Thus, in place of the priory and its noble church, was built
the residence of Thomas, Lord Audley, and here he lived
till his death in 1544. By marriage of his only daughter
and heiress, the house passed into the possession of
Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and was then called
Duke's Place.</p>

<p>Turning our backs upon Duke's Place and continuing a
little further along the way by which Stow used to fetch
the milk from the farm at the Minories to his father's
house on Cornhill, we come to Leadenhall, a great building
which served as a public granary in ancient times, and
later as the chief market hall of the city. Leaving aside
all the particulars of its history which Stow gives, let us
note what he tells us from his own recollections:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The use of Leadenhall in my youth was thus:&mdash;In a part of the
north quadrant, on the east side of the north gate, were the common
beams for weighing of wool and other wares, as had been accustomed;
on the west side the gate were the scales to weigh meal; the other
three sides were reserved, for the most part, to the making and resting
of the pageants showed at Midsummer in the watch; the remnant of
the sides and quadrants was employed for the stowage of wool sacks,
but not closed up; the lofts above were partly used by the painters in
working for the decking of pageants and other devices, for beautifying of
the watch and watchmen; the residue of the lofts were letten out to
merchants, the wool winders and packers therein to wind and pack their
wools. And thus much for Leadenhall may suffice."</p></div>

<p>The celebration of the Nativity of St. John and the
civic pageantry of Midsummer Eve belonged to the past;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
but Stow could remember the assembly of the citizens
arrayed in parti-coloured vestments of red and white
over their armour, their lances coloured and decorated
to distinguish the various wards they represented, their
torches borne in cressets on long poles. He could
remember the processions as they passed the bonfires
which burned in the open spaces of the city thoroughfares,
and the throng of faces at the open windows and
casements as they appeared in the fitful glare. The
pageantry had disappeared with the suppression of the
religious houses; but the military organization was merely
changed. The musters of the city soldiers when they
were reviewed by Queen Elizabeth at the coming of
the Armada was a recent memory.</p>

<p>And so we turn into Bishopsgate Street again, and
walk along to Crosby Hall, the ancient palace of
Richard III. In the middle of the roadway, opposite the
junction of Threadneedle Street with Bishopsgate Street,
stands a well, with a windlass, which probably existed
here before the conduit was made near the gateway in
the time of Henry VIII. We enter the precinct of
St. Helen's: the wall of Crosby's great chamber is on our
right hand; before us is the church of the nunnery. The
spirit of the place is upon us. The barriers of time are
removed; past and present mingle in the current of our
meditation. Lo! one bids us a courteous farewell: it is
Master Stow, our cicerone, who goes away in the direction
of St. Andrew Undershaft. The presence of another
influence continues to be felt. We enter the dim church,
and shadows of kneeling nuns seem to hover in the
twilight of the northern nave. Invisible fingers touch the
organ-keys; the strains of evensong arise from the choir.
Our reverie is broken, an influence recedes from us. But
turning our eyes towards the painted picture of Shakespeare
which fills the memorial window in this ancient
church, we join in the hymn of praise and thanksgiving.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span></p>

<p>What chiefly impressed the Elizabethan was the
newness of London, and the rapidity with which its ancient
features were being obliterated. John Stow felt it
incumbent upon him to make a record of the ancient city
before it was entirely swept away and forgotten. In what
was new to him we find a similar interest.</p>

<p>Through Bishopsgate northward lies Shoreditch. The
old church which stood here in Elizabethan times has
disappeared, but on the site stands another church with
the same dedication, to St. Leonard. The sweet peal of
the bells from the old belfry, so much appreciated by the
Elizabethans, is to be heard no more; but the muniment
chest of the modern church contains the old registers, in
which we may read the names of Tarleton, Queen
Elizabeth's famous jester, of Burbage, and the colony
of players who lived in this parish, in the precinct
of the dissolved priory of Holywell. The road from
Shoreditch to the precinct still exists, known as Holywell
Lane.</p>

<p>The priory of St. John Baptist, called Holywell, a house
of nuns, had been rebuilt, in the earlier period of the reign
of Henry VIII., by Sir Thomas Lovel, K.G., of Lincoln's
Inn. He endowed the priory with fair lands, extended
the buildings, and added a large chapel. He also built
considerably in Lincoln's Inn, including the fine old
gateway in Chancery Lane, which still stands as one of the
few remaining memorials of ancient London. Sir Thomas
figures as one of the characters in Shakespeare's play of
<i>Henry VIII.</i> When he died he was duly buried in the
large chapel which he had added to Holywell Priory, in
accordance with his design; but a few years later, in 1539,
the priory was surrendered to the King and dissolved.
Stow tells us that the church was pulled down&mdash;it is
doubtful if Lovel's chapel was spared&mdash;and that many
houses were built within the precinct "for the lodgings of
noblemen, of strangers born, and others."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<p>In the first edition of his <i>Survey</i> Stow added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And near thereunto are builded two publique houses for the acting
and shewe of comedies, tragedies and histories, for recreation. Whereof
one is called the Courtein, and the other the Theatre; both standing
on the south west side towards the field."</p></div>

<p>This passage was omitted from the second edition
of the book published in 1603; but the whole extensive
history of these playhouses, which was won from
oblivion by the research of J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps,
proceeded from this brief testimony of Stow.</p>


<p>Against the background of the ancient priory this
precinct of Holywell presented a perfect picture of the
new conditions which constituted what was distinctively
Elizabethan London. It comprehended the conditions of
freedom required by the new life. Outside the jurisdiction
of the city, but within the protection of the justices of
Middlesex; lying open to the common fields of Finsbury,
where archery and other sports were daily practised; its
two playhouses affording varied entertainment in fencing
matches, wrestling matches, and other "sports, shows, and
pastimes," besides stage-plays performed by the various
acting companies which visited them; this precinct of
Holywell presented a microcosm of Elizabethan London
society. The attraction of the plays brought visitors
from all parts of the city. On the days when dramatic
performances were to be given flags were hoisted in the
morning over the playhouses; and after the early midday
dinner the stream of playgoers began to flow from the
gates. On horseback and on foot, over the fields from
Cripplegate and Moorgate, or along the road from
Bishopsgate, came men and women, citizens and gallants,
visitors from the country, adventurers and pickpockets.
All classes and conditions mingled in the Theatre or
the Curtain, in the "common playhouses," as they were
called, which only came into existence in 1576, after
the players had been banished from the city. It was
all delightfully new and modern; the buildings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
gorgeously decorated; the apparel of the players was
rich and dazzling; the music was enthralling; the play
was a magic dream.</p>

<p>Some of the plays of Marlowe were performed at these
Holywell theatres; and in 1596 a play by the new poet,
William Shakespeare, called <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, was
produced at the Curtain, and caused a great sensation in
Elizabethan London. The famous balcony scene of this
play was cleverly adapted to the orchestra gallery above
the stage. The stage itself projected into the arena, and
the "groundlings" stood around it. Above were three
tiers of seated galleries, and near the stage were "lords'
rooms," the precursors of the private boxes of a later
time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the Theatre and Curtain had become a feature
of Elizabethan London at Shoreditch, other playhouses
came into existence on the other side of the river; first
at Newington, outside the jurisdiction of the city, in
conditions corresponding to those of Shoreditch. For
the sports and pastimes of Finsbury Fields, in the
neighbourhood of the playhouses, there were the sports
and pastimes of St. George's Fields in the neighbourhood
of the Newington Theatre. Playgoers from the city took
boat to Paris Garden stairs and witnessed the bear-baiting
on Bankside, or proceeded by road on horseback or on
foot to St. George's Fields and Newington; or they went
thither over the bridge all the way by road, walking or
riding. The use of coaches was very limited, owing to
the narrow roads and imperfect paving of Elizabethan
London.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">Shooting Match by the London Archers in the Year 1583.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>At Newington the proprietor and manager of the
playhouse was Philip Henslowe, whose diary is the chief
source of what information we have concerning the earlier
period of Elizabethan drama. He was a man of business
instinct, who conducted his dramatic enterprise on purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
commercial lines. In 1584 he secured the lease of a house
and two gardens on Bankside, and here, in the "liberty"
of the Bishop of Winchester, nearer to the city but
outside the civic jurisdiction, he erected his playhouse,
called the Rose, in 1591. Henslowe thus brought the
drama nearer to the city than it had been since the edict
of 1575 abolished the common stages which until then had
been set up in inn yards or other convenient places in the
city. The flag of the playhouse could be seen across
the river; and from all points came the tide of playgoers,
whose custom was a harvest to Henslowe and the Thames
watermen.</p>

<p>Midway between these two points of theatrical
attraction&mdash;Holywell, Shoreditch on the north, and
Newington and Bankside on the south&mdash;Shakespeare
lodged in the precinct of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate. The
company of players with whom he had become finally
associated was that of the Lord Chamberlain. They
derived their profits from three sources&mdash;from
performances at court, from theatrical tours, and from
performances at the Theatre and the Curtain. The
Theatre was the property of the family of James
Burbage, who had built it in 1576&mdash;his son Richard
Burbage, the famous actor, and others. The
interest of the proprietors may have suffered from
Henslowe's enterprise in setting up a playhouse on
Bankside; and they were in dispute with the ground
landlord of their playhouse in regard to the renewal of
their lease. In these circumstances the Burbages, with
the co-operation of other members of the company, secured
a site in the Winchester Liberty on Bankside, not far
from the Rose but nearer the Bridge. They then took
down their building in Holywell, vacated the land, and
re-erected the playhouse on the other side of the river.
Those who participated in this enterprise became "sharers,"
or partners, in the new playhouse. Shakespeare was one
of these, and the name by which it was called&mdash;the Globe&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
symbolical of the genius which reached its maturity
in plays presented in this theatre during the closing years
of the reign of Elizabeth and the first decade of the reign
of her successor. "Totus mundus agit histrionem" was
the inscription over the portal of the Globe. "All the
world's a stage," said Shakespeare's Jaques in <i>As You
Like It</i>. The life of Elizabethan London found its
ultimate expression in that playhouse, which became
celebrated then as "the glory of the Bank," and now is
famous in all parts of the world where the glory of
English literature is cherished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were many reminiscences of mediæval times on
the Surrey side. At Bermondsey were to be seen the
extensive remains of the great abbey of St. Saviour. After
the Dissolution its name became transferred to the church
near the end of London Bridge, formerly known as
St. Mary Overies, the splendid fane which in our time
has worthily become the cathedral of Southwark. Between
this church and the church of St. George were many inns,
among them the Tabard, where travellers to and from
Canterbury and Dover, or Winchester and Southampton,
introduced an element of novelty, change, and bustle;
where plays were performed in the inn yards before the
playhouses were built on Bankside. At the end of
Bankside, looking towards the church of St. Saviour, stood
Winchester House, the London residence of the Bishop of
Winchester since the twelfth century. Here Cardinal
Beaufort and Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester,
had lived in great state. The site, including the park,
which extended parallel with the river as far as Paris
Garden, was formerly the property of the priory of
Bermondsey. This area was under the separate
jurisdiction of the Bishops of Winchester, and was called
their "Liberty." Here, in the early years of Queen
Elizabeth, were two amphitheatres&mdash;one for bull-baiting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
the other for bear-baiting. There were also ponds for
fish, called the Pike Ponds.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The great Camden records
an anecdote of these ponds or stews, "which are here to
feed Pikes and Tenches fat, and to scour them from the
strong and muddy fennish taste." All classes delighted
in the cruel sport of bear-baiting on the Bankside:
ambassadors and distinguished foreigners were always
conducted to these performances; on special occasions
the Queen had them at the palace.</p>

<p>In 1583 one of the amphitheatres fell down, and when
re-erected it was built on the model of the playhouses.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It then became known as the Bear Garden; the bull-baiting
amphitheatre dropped out of existence; perhaps it was
reconstructed by Henslowe as his Rose theatre. The
point is not of much importance, except as regards the
evolution of the playhouse.</p>

<p>The second playhouse built on the Surrey side after the
Rose was the Swan, opened in 1596. This was erected on
a site in the manor of Paris Garden, separated only by a
road from the Liberty of Winchester. The playhouse
was in a line with the landing-stairs, opposite Blackfriars.</p>

<p>After the Globe playhouse was built in 1599, the other
playhouses&mdash;Henslowe's Rose and Langley's Swan&mdash;ceased
to flourish. Here the outward facts corresponded
with the inward: a lovely flower had opened into bloom
on the Bankside; what was unnecessary to its support
drooped earthward like a sheath.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Opposite Paris Garden, across the river, was
Blackfriars; and here the change from the ancient order
to what was distinctively Elizabethan London was most
manifest. The ancient monastery had existed here from
1276, when the Dominican or Black Friars moved hither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
from Holborn, until 1538, when the establishment was
surrendered to King Henry VIII. It possessed a
magnificent church, a vast palatial hall, and cloisters.
Edward VI. had granted the whole precinct, with its
buildings, to Sir Thomas Cawarden, the Master of the
Revels. It became an aristocratic residential quarter; and
in the earlier period of Queen Elizabeth's reign plays
were performed here, probably in the ancient hall of the
monastery, by the children of Her Majesty's chapel and
the choir-boys of St. Paul's. At a later period&mdash;viz., in
1596&mdash;James Burbage, who built the theatre in Shoreditch,
built a new playhouse in the precinct, or more probably
adapted an existing building&mdash;the hall or part of the
church&mdash;to serve the purpose of dramatic representation.
This playhouse, consequently, was not open to the weather
at the top like the common playhouses, and it was
distinguished as the "private" theatre at Blackfriars.</p>

<p>The west wall of the precinct was built along the bank
of the Fleet river. Across the river opposite was the royal
palace of Bridewell, which Edward VI. had given to the
city of London to be a workhouse for the poor and a
house of correction. This contiguity of a house for the
poor and the remains of a monastery suggests a reflection
on the social problem of Elizabethan London.</p>

<p>Before the Reformation the religious houses were the
agencies for the relief of the poor, the sick, the afflicted.
The unemployed were assisted with lodging and food on
their way as they journeyed in search of a market for
their labour, paying for their entertainment at the religious
houses by work either on the roads in the neighbourhood
or on the buildings or in the gardens and fields, according
to their trades and skill. It would seem that King Henry
did not realise the importance and extent of this
feature in the social economy, because, after he had
suppressed the religious establishments, he complained
very reproachfully of the number of masterless men and
rogues that were everywhere to be found, especially about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
London. The good Bishop Ridley, in an eloquent appeal
addressed to William Cecil, represented the poor and sick
and starving in the streets of London in the person of
Christ, beseeching the king to succour the poor and
suffering Christ in the streets of London by bestowing his
palace of Bridewell to be a home for the homeless, the
starving, and the sick, where erring ones could be corrected
and the good sustained. The good young monarch
granted the bishop's request, and Bridewell Hospital was
thus founded to do the social work in which Blackfriars
monastery on the other side of the Fleet river had formerly
borne its share. But single efforts of this kind were quite
unequal to cope with the social difficulty; and early in
the reign of Elizabeth the first Poor Law was passed and
a system of relief came into operation.</p>

<p>To meet the difficulty of unemployment, it was part
of the policy of Queen Elizabeth's Government to
encourage new industries, whether due to invention and
discovery or to knowledge gained by visiting foreign
countries to learn new processes and manufactures; the
inventor or the introducer of the novelty was rewarded
with a monopoly, and he received a licence "to take up
workmen" to be taught the methods of the new industry.
One of the manufactures which had been thus stimulated
was glass-making; and in the precinct of Blackfriars was
a famous glass-house or factory, a reminiscence of which
still exists in the name Glasshouse Yard. It has been
shown how the crafts and trades of Elizabethan London
gravitated to separate areas: Blackfriars precinct was
famous as the abode of artists; one may hazard the guess
that some of the portraits of Elizabethan and Jacobean
players in the Dulwich Gallery may have been painted
here. In the reign of Charles I. Vandyke had his studio
in Blackfriars, where the king paid him a visit to see
his pictures. The precinct was famous also as the abode
of glovers; and in the reigns of James and Charles it
became a notorious stronghold of Puritans. The existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
name of Playhouse Yard, at the back of <i>The Times</i>
newspaper office, affords some indication of the site of
the theatre; and the name Cloister Court is the sole
remnant of the cloisters of Blackfriars monastery.</p>

<p>The eastern boundary of the precinct was St. Andrew's
Hill, which still exists. On the site of the present church
of St. Andrew in the Wardrobe stood a church of the
same dedication in Elizabethan London. Stow wrote of
"the parish church of St. Andrew in the Wardrobe, a
proper church, but few monuments hath it." Near the
church (the site being indicated by the existing court called
the Wardrobe) was a building of State, which Stow calls
"the King's Great Wardrobe." The Elizabethan use of
the Wardrobe is described by Stow thus: "In this house
of late years is lodged Sir John Fortescue, knight, master
of the wardrobe, chancellor and under-treasurer of the
exchequer, and one of her majesty's most honorable privy
Council."</p>

<p>Near the top of St. Andrew's Hill and within the
precinct of Blackfriars was a house which Shakespeare
purchased in 1613. It is described in the extant
Deed of Conveyance as "now or late being in the
tenure or occupation of one William Ireland ...
abutting upon a street leading down to Puddle Wharf on
the east part, right against the Kinges Majesties
Wardrobe." Curiously enough, the name of this occupier
survives in the existing Ireland Yard.</p>

<h3>ENVOY</h3>


<p>The omissions in this imperfect sketch of Elizabethan
London are many and obvious. The design has been to
show the tangible setting of a jewel rather than the jewel
itself; the outward conditions in which the life of a new
age was manifested. The background of destruction has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
been inevitably emphasised; but in Elizabethan London
historic memorials existed on every hand. Nothing has
been said of Baynard's Castle, its Norman walls rising
from the margin of the river to the south of Blackfriars,
or of St Bartholomew the Great, or the Charterhouse, or
St. Giles's, Cripplegate; although an account of them
would have completed the outer ring of our perambulation
of the London described by Stow. The whole region
westward&mdash;Holborn, Fleet Street, the Strand, and
Westminster&mdash;has been left for another occasion. Here
and there, however, we have been able to glance at historic
buildings which had survived from earlier ages to
witness the changes in London after the Reformation.
It was those changes that led to the making of the
playhouse and brought the conditions which enfolded
the possibility realised in Shakespeare. This has been
the point of view in the foregoing pages. A study of
characteristics rather than a detailed account has been
offered for the consideration of the reader.</p></div>

<h2><a name="PEPYSS_LONDON" id="PEPYSS_LONDON">PEPYS'S LONDON</a></h2>

<p class='p3'><span class="smcap">By Henry B. Wheatley, F.S.A.</span></p>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.png" width="100" height="118" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The growth of population in London was almost
stationary for many centuries; as, owing to the
generally unhealthy condition of ancient cities,
the births seldom exceeded the deaths, and in the
case of frequent pestilences the deaths actually exceeded
the births. Thus during its early history the walls of
London easily contained its inhabitants, although at
all times in its history London will be found to have
taken a higher rank for healthy sanitary conditions than
most of its continental contemporaries. In the later
Middle Ages the city overflowed its borders, and
its liberties were recognized and marked by Bars.
Subsequently nothing was done to bring the further
out-growths of London proper within the fold, and in
Tudor times we first hear of the suburbs as disreputable
quarters, a condemnation which was doubtless just, as
the inhabitants mostly consisted of those who were glad
to escape the restrictions of life within the city walls.</p>

<p>The first great exodus westwards of the more
aristocratic inhabitants of London took place in the
reigns of James I. and Charles I.&mdash;first to Lincoln's Inn
Fields and its neighbourhood, and then to Covent
Garden, and both these suburbs were laid out by Inigo
Jones, the greatest architect of beautiful street fronts
that England has ever produced. It is an eternal
disgrace to Londoners that so many of his noble buildings
in Lincoln's Inn Fields have been destroyed. The period
of construction of these districts is marked by the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
of Henrietta and King Streets in Covent Garden, and
Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>

<p>After the Restoration modern London was founded.
During the Commonwealth there had been a considerable
stagnation in the movement of the population, and when
the Royalists returned to England from abroad they
found their family mansions in the city unfitted for their
habitation, and in consequence established themselves in
what is now the city of Westminster. Henry Jermyn,
first Earl of St. Albans, began to provide houses for
some of them in St. James's Square, and buildings in the
district around were rapidly proceeded with.</p>

<p>We have a faithful representation of London, as it
appeared at the end of the Commonwealth period, in
Newcourt and Faithorne's valuable Plan of London, dated
1658. A long growth of houses north of the Thames is
seen stretching from the Tower to the neighbourhood of
Westminster Abbey. Islington is found at the extreme
north of the plan unconnected with the streets of the
town, Hoxton connected with the city by Shoreditch,
Bethnal Green almost alone, and Stepney at the extreme
north-east. South of the Thames there are a few streets
close to the river, and a small out-growth from London
Bridge along the great southern road containing Southwark
and Bermondsey. There is little at Lambeth but
the Archbishop's Palace and the great marsh.</p>

<p>On this plan we see what was the condition of the
Haymarket and Piccadilly before the Restoration. This
was soon to be changed, for between the years 1664 and
1668 were erected three great mansions in the "Road to
Reading" (now Piccadilly), viz., Clarendon House (where
Bond and Albemarle Streets now stand), Berkeley House
(on the site now occupied by Devonshire House), and
Burlington House. Piccadilly was the original name of
the district after which Piccadilly Hall was called. The
latter place was situated at the north-east corner of the
Haymarket, nearly opposite to Panton Square, and close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
by Panton Street, named after Colonel Thomas Panton,
the notorious gamester, who purchased Piccadilly Hall
from Mrs. Baker, the widow of the original owner.</p>

<p>There is much to be said in favour of associating
the name of some well-known man with the London
of his time, and thus showing how his descriptions
illustrate the chief historical events of his time, with
many of which he may have been connected. In the
case of Samuel Pepys, we can see with his eyes
many of the incidents of the early years of the
Restoration period, and thus gain an insight into the
inner life of the times. Pepys lived through some of
the greatest changes that have passed over London, and
in alluding to some of these we may quote his remarks
with advantage. His friend, John Evelyn, also refers to
many of the same events, and may also be quoted, more
particularly as he was specially engaged at different
periods of his life in improving several parts of London.</p>

<p>We are truly fortunate in having two such admirable
diarists at hand to help us to a proper understanding of
the course of events and of the changes that took place
in London during their long lives.</p>

<p>When Pepys commenced his <i>Diary</i> on January 1st,
1660, we find him living in a small house in Axe Yard,
Westminster, a place which derived its name from a
brewhouse on the west side of King Street, called "The
Axe." He was then clerk to Mr. (afterwards Sir George)
Downing, one of the Four Tellers of the Receipt of the
Exchequer, from whom Downing Street obtained its
name. Pepys was in the receipt of £50 a year, and his
household was not a large one, for it consisted of
himself, his wife, and his servant Jane. He let the
greater part of the house, and his family lived in the
garrets. About 1767 Axe Yard was swept away, and
Fludyer Street arose on its site, named after Sir Samuel
Fludyer, who was Lord Mayor in 1761. Nearly a century
afterwards (1864-65) this street also was swept away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
(with others) to make room for the Government offices,
consisting of the India, Foreign and Colonial Offices,
etc., so that all trace of Pepys's residence has now
completely passed away.</p>

<p>Macaulay, in the famous third chapter of his History,
where he gives a brilliant picture of the state of England
in 1685, and clearly describes London under the later
Stuarts, writes: "Each of the two cities which made up
the capital of England had its own centre of attraction."
We may take this sentence as our text, and try to illustrate
it by some notices of London life in the city and at
the Court end of town. The two extremes were equally
familiar to Pepys, and both were seen by him almost
daily when he stepped into his boat by the Tower and
out of it again at Westminster.</p>

<p>To take the court life first, let us begin with the entry
of the King into London on his birthday (May 29th, 1660).
The enthusiastic reception of Charles II. is a commonplace
of history, and from the Tower to Whitehall joy
was exhibited by all that thronged the streets. Evelyn
was spectator of the scene, which he describes in his
<i>Diary</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"May 29th. This day his Majestie Charles the Second came to
London after a sad and long exile and calamitous suffering both of the
King and Church, being 17 yeares. This was also his birthday, and with
a triumph of above 20,000 horse and foote, brandishing their swords and
shouting with inexpressible joy; the wayes strew'd with flowers, the bells
ringing, the streetes hung with tapissry, fountaines running with wine;
the Maior, Aldermen and all the Companies in their liveries, chaines of
gold and banners; Lords and nobles clad in cloth of silver, gold and
velvet; the windowes and balconies all set with ladies; trumpets, music
and myriads of people flocking, even so far as Rochester, so as they
were seven houres in passing the citty, even from 2 in y<sup>e</sup> afternoon till
9 at night.</p>

<p>"I stood in the Strand and beheld it, and bless'd God. And all this
was done without one drop of blood shed, and by that very army which
rebell'd against him; but it was y<sup>e</sup> Lord's doing, for such a restauration
was never mention'd in any history antient or modern, since the returne
of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity; nor so joyfull a day and so
bright ever seene in this nation, this hapning when to expect or effect
it was past all human policy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span></p></div>

<p>One of the brilliant companies of young and
comely men in white doublets who took part in the
procession was led by Simon Wadlow, the vintner and
host of the "Devil" tavern. This was the son of Ben
Jonson's Simon Wadlow, "Old Simon the King," who
gave his name to Squire Western's favourite song. From
Rugge's curious MS. <i>Diurnal</i> we learn how the young
women of London were not behind the young men in the
desire to join in the public rejoicings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Divers maidens, in behalf of themselves and others, presented a
petition to the Lord Mayor of London, wherein they pray his Lordship
to grant them leave and liberty to meet his Majesty on the day of his
passing through the city; and if their petition be granted that they will
all be clad in white waistcoats and crimson petticoats, and other ornaments
of triumph and rejoicing."</p></div>

<p>Pepys was at sea at this time with Sir Edward
Montagu, where the sailors had their own rejoicings and
fired off three guns, but he enters in his <i>Diary</i>: "This
day, it is thought, the King do enter the city of London."</p>

<p>Charles, immediately on his arrival in London, settled
himself in the Palace of Whitehall, which was his chief
place of residence during the whole of his reign, but
although he was very much at home in it, he felt keenly
the inconveniences attending its situation by the river side,
which caused it frequently to be flooded by high tides.</p>

<p>The King alludes to this trouble in one of his
amusingly chatty speeches to the House of Commons on
March 1st, 1661-62, when arrangements were being made
for the entry of Katharine of Braganza into London.
He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The mention of my wife's arrival puts me in mind to desire you to
put that compliment upon her, that her entrance into the town may be
with more decency than the ways will now suffer it to be; and for that
purpose, I pray you would quickly pass such laws as are before you, in
order to the amending those ways, and that she may not find Whitehall
surrounded by water."</p></div>

<p>In the following year we read in Pepys's <i>Diary</i> a
piquant account of the putting out of Lady Castlemaine's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
kitchen fire on a certain occasion when Charles was
engaged to sup with her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"October 13th, 1663. My Lady Castlemaine, I hear, is in as great
favour as ever, and the King supped with her the very first night he came
from Bath: and last night and the night before supped with her; when
there being a chine of beef to roast, and the tide rising into their kitchen
that it could not be roasted there, and the cook telling her of it, she
answered, 'Zounds! she must set the house on fire, but it should be
roasted!' So it was carried to Mrs. Sarah's husband's, and there it
was roasted."</p></div>

<p>The last sentence requires an explanation. Mrs. Sarah
was Lord Sandwich's housekeeper, and Pepys had found
out in November, 1662, that she had just been married,
and that her husband was a cook. We are not told his
name or where he lived.</p>

<p>Lord Dorset, in the famous song, "To all you ladies
now on land," specially alludes to the periodical
inundations at the Palace:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The King, with wonder and surprise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But let him know it is our tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring floods of grief to Whitehall stairs."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pepys was a constant visitor to Whitehall, and the Index
to the <i>Diary</i> contains over three pages of references to
his visits. He refers to Henry VIII.'s Gallery, the
Boarded Gallery, the Matted Gallery, the Shield Gallery,
and the Vane Room. Lilly, the astrologer, mentions the
Guard Room. The Adam and Eve Gallery was so called
from a picture by Mabuse, now at Hampton Court. In
the Matted Gallery was a ceiling by Holbein, and on a
wall in the Privy Chamber a painting of Henry VII. and
Henry VIII., with their Queens, by the same artist, of
which a copy in small is preserved at Hampton Court.
On another wall was a "Dance of Death," also by
Holbein, of which Douce has given a description; and
in the bedchamber of Charles II. a representation by
Joseph Wright of the King's birth, his right to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
dominions, and miraculous preservation, with the motto,
<i>Terras Astræa revisit</i>.</p>

<p>All these rooms, and most of the lodgings of the many
residents, royal and non-royal, were in the portion of
the Palace situated on the river side of the road, now
known as Whitehall. This road was shut in by two
gates erected by Henry VIII. when he enlarged the
borders of the Palace after he had taken it from
Wolsey. The one at the Westminster end was called
the King Street gate, and the other, at the north end,
designed by Holbein, was called by his name, and also
Whitehall or Cock-pit gate.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remember that Whitehall extended
into St. James's Park. The Tilt Yard, where many
tournaments and pageants were held in the reigns of
Henry VIII., Elizabeth, and James I., fronted the
Banqueting House, and occupied what is now the Horse
Guards' Parade. On the south side of the Tilt Yard was
the Cockpit, where Monk, Duke of Albemarle, lived for a
time. His name was given to a tavern in the Tilt Yard
("The Monk's Head").</p>

<p>On the north side was Spring Gardens, otherwise the
King's Garden, but it subsequently became a place of
public entertainment, and after the Restoration it was
styled the Old Spring Garden; then the ground was
built upon, and the entertainments removed to the New
Spring Garden at Lambeth, afterwards called Vauxhall.</p>

<p>The Cockpit was originally used for cock-fighting,
but it cannot be definitely said when it ceased to be
employed for this cruel sport. It was for a considerable
time used as a royal theatre, and Malone wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Neither Elizabeth, nor James I., nor Charles I., I believe, ever
went to the public theatre, but they frequently ordered plays to be performed
at Court, which were represented in the royal theatre called the
Cockpit."</p></div>

<p>Malone is probably incorrect in respect to Elizabeth's use
of the Cockpit, for certainly cock-fighting was practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
here as late as 1607, as may be seen from the following
entry in the State Papers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Aug. 4th, 1607. Warrant to pay 100 marks per annum to William
Gateacre for breeding, feeding, etc., the King's game cocks during the
life of George Coliner, Cockmaster."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>It is, of course, possible that the players and the cocks
occupied the place contemporaneously.</p>

<p>The lodgings at the Cockpit were occupied by some
well-known men. Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke and
Montgomery, saw Charles I. pass from St. James's to the
scaffold at the Banqueting House from one of his
windows, and he died in these apartments on January
23rd, 1650. Oliver Cromwell, when Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland, was given, by order of Parliament, "the use of
the lodgings called the Cockpit, of the Spring Garden
and St. James's House, and the command of St. James's
Park," and when Protector, and in possession of
Whitehall Palace, he still retained the Cockpit. When
in 1657 he relaxed some of the prohibitions against
the Theatre, he used the Cockpit stage occasionally for
instrumental and vocal music.</p>

<p>A little before the Restoration the apartments were
assigned to General Monk, and Charles II. confirmed the
arrangement. Here he died, as Duke of Albemarle, on
January 3rd, 1670. In 1673 George Villiers, second
Duke of Buckingham, became a resident, and at the
Revolution of 1688 the Princess Anne was living here.</p>

<p>There has been some confusion in respect to the
references to the Cockpit in Pepys's <i>Diary</i>, as two distinct
theatres are referred to under this name. The references
before November, 1660, are to the performances of the
Duke's Company at the Cockpit in Drury Lane. Here
Pepys saw the "Loyal Subject," "Othello," "Wit without
Money," and "The Woman's Prize or Tamer Tamed."
The subsequent passages in which the Cockpit is referred
to apply to the royal theatre attached to Whitehall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
Palace. Here Pepys saw "The Cardinal," "Claricilla,"
"Humorous Lieutenant," "Scornful Lady," and the
"Valiant Cid." It is useful to remember that the
performances at Whitehall were in the evening, and
those at the public theatre in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The buildings of the Old Whitefriars Palace by the
river side were irregular and unimposing outside, although
they were handsome inside. The grand scheme of Inigo
Jones for rebuilding initiated by James I., and
occasionally entertained by Charles I. and II. and
William III., came to nothing, but the noble Banqueting
House remains to show what might have been.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Sheppard, in his valuable work on <i>The
Old Palace of Whitehall</i> (1902), refers to Grinling
Gibbons's statue of James II., which for many years stood
in the Privy Garden, and is one of the very few good
statues in London. He refers to the temporary removal
of the statue to the front of Gwydyr House, and writes:
"Since the statue has been removed to its present position
an inscription (there was none originally) has been placed
on its stone pedestal. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
JACOBUS SECUNDUS<br />
DEI GRATIA ANGLIÆ SCOTIÆ FRANCIÆ<br />
ET HIBERNIÆ REX.<br />
FIDEI DEFENSOR. ANNO MDCLXXXVI."<br />
</p>

<p>This, however, is a mistake, and the inscription runs
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
JACOBUS SECUNDUS<br />
DEI GRATIÆ<br />
ANGLIÆ SCOTIÆ<br />
FRANCIÆ ET<br />
HIBERNIÆ<br />
REX<br />
FIDEI DEFENSOR<br />
ANNO MDCLXXXVI<br />
</p>

<p>in capitals, and without any stops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span></p>

<p>The present writer remembers well being taken as
a little boy to read the inscription and find out the
error in the Latin. The statue has since been removed
to the front of the new buildings of the Admiralty
between the Horse Guards' Parade and Spring
Gardens, a very appropriate position for a Lord High
Admiral. I am happy to see that the inscription has
not been altered, and the incorrect "Dei gratiæ"
appears as in my youth.</p>

<p>James Duke of York, after the Restoration, occupied
apartments in St. James's Palace, and his Secretary of
the Admiralty, Sir William Coventry, had lodgings
conveniently near him. The Duke sometimes moved
from one palace to the other, as his father, Charles I.,
had done before him. Henrietta Maria took a fancy to
the place, and most of their children were born at
St. James's, the Duke being one of these.</p>

<p>James's changes of residence are recorded in Pepys's
<i>Diary</i> as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Jan. 23rd, 1664-65. Up and with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen
to White Hall; but there finding the Duke gone to his lodgings at
St. James's for alltogether, his Duchesse being ready to lie in, we to him
and there did our usual business."</p>

<p>"May 3rd, 1667. Up and with Sir J. Minnes, W. Batten and W. Pen
in the last man's coach to St. James's, and thence up to the Duke of
York's chamber, which as it is now fretted at the top, and the chimney-piece
made handsome, is one of the noblest and best-proportioned rooms
that ever, I think, I saw in my life."</p>

<p>"May 20th, 1668. Up and with Colonell Middleton in a new coach
he hath made him, very handsome, to White Hall, where the Duke
of York having removed his lodgings for this year to St. James's we
walked thither; and there find the Duke of York coming to White Hall,
and so back to the Council Chamber, where the Committee of the
Navy sat."</p></div>

<p>In November, 1667, James fell ill of the smallpox in
St. James's Palace, when the gallery doors were locked
up. On March 31st, 1671, Anne Duchess of York, the
daughter of Clarendon, died here. The Princess Mary
was married to William Prince of Orange in November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
1677, at eleven o'clock at night, in the Chapel Royal,
and on July 28th, 1683, Princess Anne to Prince George
of Denmark, when the pair took up their residence at
St. James's.</p>

<p>When James came to the crown he went to live at
Whitehall Palace, but he frequently stayed at St. James's.
On June 9th, 1688, Queen Mary of Modena was taken to
the latter place, and on the following day James Francis
Edward, afterwards known as "The Pretender," was born
in the Old Bedchamber. This room was situated at the
east end of the south front. It had three doors, one
leading to a private staircase at the head of the bed, and
two windows opposite the bed.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The room was pulled down previous to the alterations
made in the year 1822.</p>

<p>The anecdote of Charles II. and the chaplains of the
Chapel Royal is often quoted, but it is worth repeating,
as it shows the ready wit of the great preacher, Dr. South.
A daily dinner was prepared at the Palace for the
chaplains, and one day the King notified his intention
of dining with them. There had been some talk of
abolishing this practice, and South seized the opportunity
of saying grace to do his best in opposition to the
suggestion; so, instead of the regular formula, which was
"God save the King and bless the dinner," said "God
bless the King and save the dinner." Charles at once
cried out, "And it shall be saved."</p>

<p>The Duke of York and the King were fond of
wandering about the park at all hours, and as Charles
often walked by himself, even as far as the then secluded
Constitution Hill, James having expressed fears for his
safety, the elder brother made the memorable reply:
"No kind of danger, James, for I am sure no man in
England will take away my life to make you king."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span></p>

<p>Pepys tells us on March 16th, 1661-2, that while he
was walking in the park he met the King and Duke
coming "to see their fowl play."</p>

<p>Cosmo III., Grand Duke of Tuscany (then Hereditary
Prince), made a "Tour through England" in 1669, and it
will be remembered that Macaulay found the account of
his travels a valuable help towards obtaining a picture
of the state of England in the middle of the seventeenth
century. Cosmo thus describes St. James's Park:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A large park enclosed on every side by a wall, and containing a
long, straight, and spacious walk, intended for the amusement of the
Mall, on each side of which grow large elms whose shade render the
promenade in that place in summer infinitely pleasant and agreeable;
close to it is a canal of nearly the same length, on which are several
species of aquatic birds, brought up and rendered domestic&mdash;the work of
the Protector Cromwell; the rest of the park is left uncultivated, and
forms a wood for the retreat of deer and other quadrupeds."</p></div>

<p>His Highness was not quite correct in giving the
credit of the collection of wild-fowl to Cromwell, as the
water-fowl appear to have been kept in the park from the
reign of Elizabeth, and the ponds were replenished after
the Restoration.</p>

<p>Evelyn gives a long account in his <i>Diary</i> of the
zoological collections (February 9th, 1664-65). He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The parke was at this time stored with numerous flocks of severall
sorts of ordinary and extraordinary wild fowle, breeding about the
Decoy, which for being neere so greate a citty, and among such a
concourse of souldiers and people, is a singular and diverting thing.
There were also deere of several countries, white; spotted like leopards;
antelopes, an elk, red deere, roebucks, staggs, guinea goates, Arabian
sheepe, etc. There were withy pots or nests for the wild fowle to lay
their eggs in, a little above y<sup>e</sup> surface of y<sup>e</sup> water."</p></div>

<p>Charles II. was a saunterer by nature, and he appears
to have been quite happy in the park either chatting with
Nell Gwyn, at the end of the garden of her Pall Mall
house, in feeding the fowl, or in playing the game of
Mall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span></p>

<p>This game was popular from the end of the sixteenth
to the beginning of the eighteenth century, and then went
out of fashion. At one time there were few large towns
without a mall, or prepared ground where the game could
be played. There is reason to believe that the game was
introduced into England from Scotland on the accession
of James VI. to the English throne, because the King
names it in his "Basilicon D&#333;ron" among other exercises
as suited for his son Henry, who was afterwards Prince
of Wales, and about the same time Sir R. Dallington, in
his <i>Method of Travel</i> (1598), expresses his surprise that
the sport was not then introduced into England.</p>

<p>The game was played in long shaded alleys, and on
dry gravel walks. The mall in St. James's Park was
nearly half a mile in length, and was kept with the
greatest care. Pepys relates how he went to talk with
the keeper of the mall, and how he learned the manner
of mixing the earth for the floor, over which powdered
cockle-shells were strewn. All this required such
attention that a special person was employed for the
purpose, who was called the cockle-strewer. In dry
weather the surface was apt to turn to dust, and
consequently to impede the flight of the ball, so that
the cockle-strewer's office was by no means a sinecure.
Richard Blome, writing in 1673, asserts that this mall
was "said to be the best in Christendom," but Evelyn
claims the pre-eminence for that at Tours, with its seven
rows of tall elms, as "the noblest in Europe for length
and shade." The game is praised by Sir R. Dallington
"because it is a gentlemanlike sport, not violent, and
yields good occasion and opportunity of discourse as
they walke from one marke to the other," and Joseph
Lauthier, who wrote a treatise on the subject, entitled
<i>Le Jeu de Mail</i>, Paris, 1717 (which is now extremely
scarce), uses the same form of recommendation.</p>

<p>The chief requisites for the game were mallets, balls,
two arches or hoops, one at either end of the mall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
a wooden border marked so as to show the position of the
balls when played. The mallets were of different size
and form to suit the various players, and Lauthier directs
that the weight and height of the mallet should be in
proportion to the strength and stature of the player.
The balls were of various sizes and weights, and each
size had its distinct name. In damp weather, when the
soil was heavy, a lighter ball was required than when
the soil was sandy. A gauge was used to ascertain its
weight, and the weight of the mallet was adjusted to
that of the ball. The arch or pass was about two feet
high and two inches wide. The one at the west end of
St. James's Park remained in its place for many years,
and was not cleared away until the beginning of the reign
of George III. In playing the game, the mallet was
raised above the head and brought down with great force
so as to strike the ball to a considerable distance. The
poet Waller describes Charles II.'s stroke in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here a well-polished Mall gives us joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see our prince his matchless force employ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner has he touch'd the flying ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'tis already more than half the Mall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a fury from his arm has got,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from a smoking culverin 'twere shot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Considerable skill and practice were required in the
player, who, while attempting to make the ball skate
along the ground with speed, had to be careful that he
did not strike it in such a manner as to raise it from
the ground. This is shown by what Charles Cotton
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But playing with the boy at Mall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I rue the time and ever shall),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I struck the ball, I know not how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For that is not the play, you know),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pretty height into the air."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This boy was, perhaps, a caddie, for it will be seen that
the game was a sort of cross between golf and croquet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p>Lauthier describes four ways of playing at pall mall,
viz.:&mdash;(1) the <i>rouet</i>, or pool game; (2) <i>en partie</i>, a match
game; (3) <i>à grands coups</i>, at long shots; and (4) <i>chicane</i>,
or hockey. Moreover, he proposes a new game to be
played like billiards.</p>

<p>We may now pass from St. James's Park to Hyde
Park, which became a place of public resort in the reigns
of James I. and Charles I. It was then considered to be
quite a country place. Ben Jonson mentions in the
Prologue to his comedy, <i>The Staple of News</i> (1625), the
number of coaches which congregated there, and Shirley
describes the horse-races in his comedy entitled <i>Hide
Parke</i> (1637).</p>

<p>The park, being Crown property, was sold by order
of Parliament in 1652 for about £17,000 in three lots,
the purchasers being Richard Wilcox, John Tracy, and
Anthony Deane. Cromwell was a frequent visitor, and
on one occasion when he was driving in the park his
horses ran away, and he was thrown off his coach.</p>

<p>After the Restoration the park was the daily resort of
all the gallantry of the court, and Pepys found driving
there very pleasant, although he complained of the dust.
The Ring, which is described in Grammont's <i>Memoirs</i> as
"the rendezvous of magnificence and beauty," was a
small enclosure of trees round which the carriages
circulated.</p>

<p>Pepys writes April 4th, 1663:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"After dinner to Hide Park ... At the Park was the King
and in another coach my Lady Castlemaine, they greeting one another
at every tour."</p></div>

<p>This passage is illustrated in Wilson's <i>Memoirs</i>, 1719,
where we are told that when the coaches "have turned for
some time round one way, they face about and turn
t'other."</p>

<p>John Macky, in his <i>Journey through England</i> (1724),
affirms that in fine weather he had seen above three
hundred coaches at a time making "the Grand Tour."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span></p>

<p>Cosmo tells of the etiquette which was observed
among the company:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The King and Queen are often there, and the duke and duchess,
towards whom at the first meeting and no more all persons show the
usual marks of respect, which are afterwards omitted, although they
should chance to meet again ever so often, every one being at full liberty,
and under no constraint whatever, and to prevent the confusion and
disorder which might arise from the great number of lackies and footmen,
these are not permitted to enter Hyde Park, but stop at the gate
waiting for their masters."</p></div>

<p>Oldys refers to a poem, printed in sixteen pages,
which was entitled "The Circus, or British Olympicks: a
Satyr on the Ring in Hyde Park." He says that the
poem satirizes many well-known fops under fictitious
names, and he raises the number of coaches seen on a fine
evening from Macky's three hundred to a thousand. The
Ring was partly destroyed at the time the Serpentine was
formed by Caroline, Queen of George II.</p>

<p>Although the Ring has disappeared, Hyde Park has
remained from the Restoration period until the present
day the most fashionable place in London, but now the
whole park has been utilized.</p>

<p>Charles II., in reviving the Stage, specially patronised
it himself, and it may be referred to here from its
connection with the Court. It has already been noticed
that previous monarchs did not visit the public theatres.</p>

<p>Pepys was an enthusiastic playgoer, and the <i>Diary</i>
contains a mass of information respecting the Stage not
elsewhere to be found, so that we are able to trace the
various advances made in the revival of the Stage from
the incipient attempt of Davenant before the Restoration
to the improvements in scenery introduced by the rivalry
of the two managers, Davenant and Killigrew.
Immediately after the Restoration two companies of
actors were organized, who performed at two different
houses. One theatre was known as the King's House,
called by Pepys "The Theatre," and the other as the
Duke's House, called by Pepys "The Opera." Sir William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
Davenant obtained a patent for his company as "The
Duke's Servants," named after the Duke of York, and
Thomas Killigrew obtained one for "The King's
Servants."</p>

<p>Killigrew's Company first performed at the "Red
Bull," Clerkenwell, and on November 8th removed to
Gibbons's Tennis Court in Bear Yard, which was entered
from Vere Street, Clare Market. Here the Company
remained till 1663, when they removed to Drury Lane
Theatre, which had been built for their reception, and
was opened on May 7th.</p>

<p>Davenant's Company first performed at the Cockpit,
Drury Lane. They began to play at Salisbury Court
Theatre on November 13th, 1660, and went to Cobham
House, Blackfriars, on the site afterwards occupied by
Apothecaries' Hall, in January, 1661. They then removed
to the theatre in Portugal Row, built on the site of Lisle's
Tennis Court. Rhodes, a bookseller, who had formerly
been wardrobe keeper at the Blackfriars, had managed in
1659 to obtain a licence from the State, and John Downes
affirms that his company acted at the Cockpit, but
apparently he was acting at the Salisbury Court Theatre
before Davenant went there. Killigrew, however, soon
succeeded in suppressing Rhodes. Davenant planned a
new building in Dorset Gardens, which was close to
Salisbury Court, where the former theatre was situated.
He died, however, before it was finished, but the
company removed there in 1671, and the theatre was
opened on the 9th of November with Dryden's play,
<i>Sir Martin Mar-all</i>, which he had improved from a
rough draft by the Duke of Newcastle. Pepys had seen
it seven times in the years 1667-68. The Lincoln's Inn
Fields Theatre remained shut up until February, 1672,
when the King's Company, burnt out of Drury Lane
Theatre, made use of it till March, 1674, by which time
the new building in Brydges Street, Covent Garden, was
ready for their occupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span></p>

<p>When Tom Killigrew died in 1682 the King's and the
Duke's companies were united, and the Duke's servants
removed from Dorset Gardens to Drury Lane. The two
companies performed together for the first time on
November 16th.</p>

<p>These constant changes are very confusing, and the
recital of them is not very entertaining, but it is necessary
to make the matter clear for the proper understanding of
the history of the time. The plan of the old theatres,
with their platform stage, was no longer of use for the
altered arrangements introduced at the Restoration.
Successive improvements in the form of the houses were
made, but we learn from Pepys that it was some time
before the roofing of the building was water-tight.</p>

<p>The public theatres were open in the afternoon, three
o'clock being the usual hour for performance, and the
plays were therefore partly acted in the summer by
daylight. It was thus necessary to have skylights, but
these were so slight that heavy rain came and wetted
those below. On June 1st, 1664, Pepys wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Before the play was done it fell such a storm of hail that we in the
middle of the pit were fain to rise, and all the house in a disorder."</p></div>

<p>Davenant was the original planner of the modern
stage and its scenery, but Killigrew did his part in the
improvement carried out. He was somewhat jealous of
his brother manager, and on one occasion he explained to
Pepys what he himself had done:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Feb. 12th, 1666-67. The stage is now by his pains a thousand
times better and more glorious than ever heretofore. Now, wax candles,
and many of them; then not above 3 lbs. of tallow: now all things civil,
no rudeness anywhere; then as in a bear garden: then two or three
fiddlers, now nine or ten of the best: then nothing but rushes upon the
ground, and everything else mean; and now all otherwise; then the
Queen seldom and the King never would come; now, not the King only
for State but all civil people do think they may come as well as any."</p></div>

<p>Killigrew complained that "the audience at his house
was not above half as much as it used to be before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
late fire," but in the following year (February 6th, 1667-8)
there were crowds at the other house. Pepys relates:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Home to dinner, and my wife being gone before, I to the Duke of
York's playhouse; where a new play of Etheridge's called 'She Would
if she Could,' and though I was there by two o'clock, there were 1,000
people put back that could not have room in the pit."</p></div>

<p>Pepys's criticisms on the plays he saw acted at these
theatres were not always satisfactory, and often they
were contradictory. At the same time he was apparently
judicious in the disposal of praise and blame on the
actors he saw. Betterton was his ideal of the perfect
actor, and, so far as it is possible to judge as to one
who lived so long ago, public opinion formed by those
capable of judging from contemporary report seems to
be in agreement with that of Pepys.</p>

<p>Pepys was a great frequenter of taverns and inns,
as were most of his contemporaries. There are about
one hundred and thirty London taverns mentioned in
the <i>Diary</i>, but time has swept away nearly all of these
houses, and it is difficult to find any place which Pepys
frequented.</p>

<p>These taverns may be considered as a link between
the Court end of London and the city, for Pepys
distributed his favours between the two places. King
Street, Westminster, was full of inns, and Pepys seems
to have frequented them all. Two of them&mdash;the "Dog"
and the "Sun"&mdash;are mentioned in Herrick's address to
the shade of "Glorious Ben":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, Ben!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say how or when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we thy guests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet at these feasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made at the Sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dog, the Triple Tunne?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where we such clusters had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As made us nobly wild, not mad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet such verse of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outdid the meate, outdid the frolic wine."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "Three Tuns" at Charing Cross, visited by
Pepys, was probably the same house whose sign Herrick
changes to "Triple Tun."</p>

<p>Among the Westminster taverns may be mentioned
"Heaven" and "Hell," two places of entertainment at
Westminster Hall; the "Bull Head" and the "Chequers"
and the "Swan" at Charing Cross; the "Cock" in Bow
Street and the "Fleece" in York Street, Covent Garden;
the "Canary" house by Exeter Change; and the "Blue
Balls" in Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>

<p>The majority of these taverns patronised by Pepys
were, however, in the city. There were several "Mitres"
in London, but perhaps the most interesting one was that
kept in Fenchurch Street by Daniel Rawlinson, a staunch
royalist, who, when Charles I. was executed, hung his
sign in mourning. Thomas Hearne says that naturally
made him suspected by the Roundheads, but "endeared
him so much to the Churchmen that he throve amain and
got a good estate." His son, Sir Thomas Rawlinson, was
Lord Mayor in 1700, and President of Bridewell
Hospital. His two grandsons, Thomas and Richard
Rawlinson, hold an honourable place in the roll of
eminent book collectors. The "Samson" in St. Paul's
Churchyard was another famous house, as also the
"Dolphin" in Tower Street, a rendezvous of the Navy
officers, which provided very good and expensive
dinners.</p>

<p>The "Cock" in Threadneedle Street was an old-established
house when Pepys visited it on March 7th,
1659-60, and it lasted till 1840, when it was cleared
away. In the eighteenth century it was a constant
practice for the frequenters of the "Cock" to buy a chop
or steak at the butcher's and bring it to be cooked, the
charge for which was one penny. Fox's friend, the
notorious Duke of Norfolk, known as "Jockey of
Norfolk," often bought his chop and brought it here
to be cooked, until his rank was discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span></p>

<p>The meetings of the Royal Society were held at
Gresham College in Bishopsgate Street, and then at
Arundel House in the Strand, which was lent to the
Society by Henry Howard of Norfolk, afterwards Duke
of Norfolk. Cosmo of Tuscany visited the latter place
for a meeting of the Royal Society, and he gives in his
<i>Travels</i> an interesting account of the manner in which the
proceedings were carried out.</p>

<p>There are many references in Pepys's <i>Diary</i> to the
Lord Mayor and the Rulers of the City, and of the
customs carried out there.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor, aldermen, and common councilmen
visited Cosmo, who was staying at Lord St. Alban's
mansion in St. James's Square. His Highness, having
dined with the King at the Duke of Buckingham's,
kept the city magnates waiting for a time, but Colonel
Gascoyne, "to make the delay less tedious, had
accommodated himself to the national taste by ordering
liquor and amusing them with drinking toasts, till it
was announced that His Highness was ready to give
them audience." The description of the audience is very
interesting.</p>

<p>Pepys lived in the city at the Navy Office in Seething
Lane (opposite St. Olave's, Hart Street, the church he
attended) during the whole of the time he was writing
his <i>Diary</i>, but when he was Secretary of the Admiralty
he went, in 1684, to live at the end of Buckingham
Street, Strand, in a house on the east side which looks on
to the river.</p>

<p>Mr. John Eliot Hodgkin possesses the original lease
(dated September 30th, 1687) from the governor and
company of the New River for a supply of water through
a half-inch pipe, and four small cocks of brass led from
the main pipe in Villiers Street to Samuel Pepys's house
in York Buildings, also a receipt for two quarters' rent
for the same.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span></p>

<p>Two of the greatest calamities that could overtake
any city occurred in London during the writing of the
<i>Diary</i>, and were fully described by Pepys&mdash;viz., the
Plague of 1665 and the Fire of 1666. Defoe's most
interesting history of the plague year was written in
1722 at second hand, for the writer was only two years
old when this scourge overran London. Pepys wrote
of what he saw, and as he stuck to his duty during the
whole time that the pestilence continued, he saw much
that occurred.</p>

<p>England was first visited with the plague in 1348-49,
which, since 1833 (when Hecker's work on the <i>Epidemics
of the Middle Ages</i> was first published in English),
has been styled the Black Death&mdash;a translation of the
German term "Der Schwarze Tod." This plague had the
most momentous effect upon the history of England
on account of the fearful mortality it caused. It
paralysed industry, and permanently altered the position
of the labourer. The statistics of the writers of the
Middle Ages are of little value, and the estimates of
those who died are various, but the statement that
half the population of England died from the plague
is probably not far from the truth. From 1348 to 1665
plague was continually occurring in London, but it has
not appeared since the last date, except on a small
scale. Dr. Creighton gives particulars of the visitations
in London in 1603, 1625, and 1665, from which it
appears that the mortality in 1665 was more than
double that in 1603, and about a third more than that
in 1625.</p>

<p>On the 7th of June, 1665, Pepys for the first time saw
two or three houses marked with the red cross, and the
words "Lord, have mercy upon us" upon the doors, and
the sight made him feel so ill-at-ease that he was forced
to buy some roll tobacco to smell and chew.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
27th of this month he writes: "The plague encreases
mightily."</p>

<p>According to the Bills of Mortality, the total number
of deaths in London for the week ending June 27th
was 684, of which number 267 were deaths from the
plague. The number of deaths rose week by week until
September 19th, when the total was 8,297, and the deaths
from the plague 7,165. On September 26th the total
had fallen to 6,460, and deaths from the plague to
5,533. The number fell gradually, week by week, till
October 31st, when the total was 1,388, and the deaths
from the plague 1,031. On November 7th there was a
rise to 1,787 and 1,414 respectively. On November 14th
the numbers had gone down to 1,359 and 1,050 respectively.
On December 12th the total had fallen to 442,
and deaths from plague to 243. On December 19th
there was a rise to 525 and 281 respectively. The total
of burials in 1665 was 97,306, of which number the
plague claimed 68,596 victims. Most of the inhabitants
of London who could get away took the first opportunity
of escaping from the town, and in 1665 there were many
places that the Londoner could visit with considerable
chance of safety. The court went to Oxford, and afterwards
came back to Hampton Court before venturing
to return to Whitehall. The clergy and the doctors fled
with very few exceptions, and several of those who
stayed in town doing the duty of others, as well as
their own, fell victims to the scourge.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth would have none of these removals.
Stow says that in the time of the plague of 1563, "a
gallows was set up in the Market-place of Windsor to
hang all such as should come there from London."</p>

<p>Dr. Hodges, author of <i>Loimologia</i>, enumerates among
those who assisted in the dangerous work of restraining
the progress of the infection were the learned Dr. Gibson,
Regius Professor at Cambridge; Dr. Francis Glisson,
Dr. Nathaniel Paget, Dr. Peter Barwick, Dr. Humphrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
Brookes, etc. Of those he mentions eight or nine fell
in their work, among whom was Dr. William Conyers,
to whose goodness and humanity he bears the most
honourable testimony. Dr. Alexander Burnett, of
Fenchurch Street, one of Pepys's friends, was another
of the victims.</p>

<p>Of those to whom honour is due special mention
must be made of Monk, Duke of Albemarle, Evelyn,
Pepys, Edmond Berry Godfrey; and there were, of
course, others.</p>

<p>The Duke of Albemarle stayed at the Cockpit;
Evelyn sent his wife and family to Wotton, but he
remained in town himself, and had very arduous duties
to perform, for he was responsible for finding food and
lodging for the prisoners of war, and he found it difficult
to get money for these purposes. He tells in his <i>Diary</i>
how he was received by Charles II. and the Duke of
York on January 29th, 1665-6, when the pestilence had
partly abated and the court had ventured from Oxford
to Hampton Court. The King</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"... ran towards me, and in a most gracious manner gave me his
hand to kisse, with many thanks for my care and faithfulnesse in his
service in a time of such greate danger, when everybody fled their employment;
he told me he was much obliged to me, and said he was several
times concerned for me, and the peril I underwent, and did receive my
service most acceptably (though in truth I did but do my duty, and O
that I had performed it as I ought!) After that his Majesty was pleased
to talke with me alone, neere an houre, of severall particulars of my
employment and ordered me to attend him againe on the Thursday
following at Whitehall. Then the Duke came towards me, and embraced
me with much kindnesse, telling me if he had thought my danger would
have been so greate, he would not have suffered his Majesty to employ
me in that station."</p></div>

<p>Pepys refers, on May 1st, 1667, to his visit to Sir
Robert Viner's, the eminent goldsmith, where he saw
"two or three great silver flagons, made with inscriptions
as gifts of the King to such and such persons of quality
as did stay in town [during] the late plague for keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
things in order in the town, which is a handsome thing."
Godfrey was a recipient of a silver tankard, and he
was knighted by the King in September, 1666, for his
efforts to preserve order in the Great Fire. The remembrance
of his death, which had so great an influence on
the spread of the "Popish Plot" terror, is greater than
that of his public spirit during the plague and the fire.</p>

<p>Pepys lived at Greenwich and Woolwich during the
height of the plague, but he was constantly in London.
How much these men must have suffered is brought
very visibly before us in one of the best letters Pepys
ever wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To Lady Casteret, from Woolwich, Sept. 4, 1655. The absence of
the court and emptiness of the city takes away all occasion of news, save
only such melancholy stories as would rather sadden than find your ladyship
any divertissement in the hearing. I have stayed in the city till
about 7,400 died in one week, and of them above 6,000 of the plague, and
little noise heard day or night but tolling of bells; till I could walk
Lumber Street and not meet twenty persons from one end to the other,
and not fifty on the Exchange; till whole families have been swept away;
till my very physician, Dr. Burnett, who undertook to secure me against
any infection, having survived the month of his own house being shut
up, died himself of the plague; till the nights, though much lengthened,
are grown too short to conceal the burials of those that died the day
before, people thereby constrained to borrow daylight for that service;
lastly, till I could find neither meat nor drink safe, the butchers being
everywhere visited, my brewer's house shut up, and my baker, with his
whole family, dead of the plague."</p></div>

<p class='center'><i>The view shows Ludgate in the foreground, and in the distance St. Paul's Cathedral
and the Tower of St. Mary-le-Bow.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Before the first calamity of pestilence was ended the
second calamity of fire commenced. On the night of
September 1st, 1666, many houses were destroyed. At
three o'clock in the morning of the 2nd (Sunday) his
servant Jane awoke Pepys to tell him that a great fire
was raging. Not thinking much of the information, he
went to sleep again, but when he rose at seven he found
that about 300 houses had been burned in the night. He
went first to the Tower, and saw the Lieutenant. Then
he took boat to Whitehall to see the King. He tells of
what he has seen, and says that, unless His Majesty will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
command houses to be pulled down, nothing can stop
the fire. On hearing this the King instructs him to go
to the Lord Mayor (Sir Thomas Bludworth) and command
him to pull down houses in every direction. The
Mayor seems to have been but a poor creature, and when
he heard the King's message</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"... he cried like a fainting woman, 'Lord! what can I do? I am
spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses, but
the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.'"</p></div>

<p>Fortunately, most of the Londoners were more
vigorous than the Mayor. The King and the Duke of
York interested themselves in the matter, and did their
best to help those who were busy in trying to stop the
fire. Evelyn wrote on September 6th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is not indeede imaginable how extraordinary the vigilance and
activity of the King and the Duke was, even labouring in person,
and being present to command, order, reward, or encourage workmen,
by which he showed his affection to his people and gained theirs."</p></div>

<p>Sir William Penn and Pepys were ready in resource,
and saw to the blowing up of houses to check the spread
of the flames, the former bringing workmen out of the
dockyards to help in the work. During the period when
it was expected that the Navy Office would be destroyed,
Pepys sent off his money, plate, and most treasured
property to Sir W. Rider, at Bethnal Green, and then he
and Penn dug a hole in their garden, in which they put
their wine and parmezan cheese.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September, Sir W. Rider let it be
known that, as the town is full of the report respecting
the wealth in his house, he will be glad if his friends
will provide for the safety of their property elsewhere.</p>

<p>On September 5th, when Evelyn went to Whitehall,
the King commanded him</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"... among the rest to looke after the quenching of Fetter Lane end,
to preserve if possible that part of Holborn, whilst the rest of y<sup>e</sup> gentlemen
tooke their several posts, some at one part, some at another (for now
they began to bestir themselves and not till now, who hitherto had stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
as men intoxicated with their hands acrosse) and began to consider that
nothing was likely to put a stop but the blowing up of so many houses
as might make a wider gap than any had yet been made by the ordinary
method of pulling them downe with engines."</p></div>

<p>The daily records of the fire and of the movements
of the people are most striking. Now we see the river
crowded with boats filled with the goods of those who
are houseless, and then we pass to Moorfields, where are
crowds carrying their belongings about with them, and
doing their best to keep these separate till some huts
can be built to receive them. Soon paved streets and
two-storey houses were seen in Moorfields, the city
authorities having let the land on leases for seven
years.</p>

<p>The wearied people complained that their feet
were "ready to burn" through walking in the streets
"among the hot coals."</p>

<p>(September 5th, 1666.) Means were provided to save
the unfortunate multitudes from starvation, and on this
same day proclamation was made</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"... ordering that for the supply of the distressed persons left
destitute ... great proportions of bread be brought daily, not only
to the former markets, but to those lately ordained. Churches and public
places were to be thrown open for the reception of poor people and their
goods."</p></div>

<p>Westminster Hall was filled with "people's goods."</p>

<p>On September 7th Evelyn went towards Islington
and Highgate</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"... where one might have seen 200,000 people of all ranks and
degrees dispers'd and lying along by their heapes of what they could
save from the fire, deploring their losse, and tho' ready to perish for
hunger and destitution yet not asking one penny for reliefe, which to
me appear'd a stranger sight than any I had yet beheld."</p></div>

<p>The fire was fairly got under on September 7th, but
on the previous day Clothworkers' Hall was burning,
as it had been for three days and nights, in one
volume of flame. This was caused by the cellars being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
full of oil. How long the streets remained in a
dangerous condition may be guessed by Pepys's
mention, on May 16th, 1666-7, of the smoke issuing
from the cellars in the ruined streets of London.</p>

<p>The fire consumed about five-sixths of the whole
city, and outside the walls a space was cleared about
equal to an oblong square of a mile and a half in
length and half a mile in breadth. Well might Evelyn
say, "I went againe to y<sup>e</sup> ruines for it was no longer a
citty" (September 10th, 1666).</p>

<p>The destruction was fearful, and the disappearance
of the grand old Cathedral of St. Paul's was among the
most to be regretted of the losses. One reads these
particulars with a sort of dulled apathy, and it requires
such a terribly realistic picture as the following, by
Evelyn, to bring the scene home to us in all its magnitude
and horror:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The conflagration was so universal, and the people so astonish'd, that
from the beginning I know not by what despondency or fate, they hardly
stirr'd to quench it, so that there was nothing heard or seene but crying
out and lamentation, running about like distracted creatures without at
all attempting to save even their goods; such a strange consternation there
was upon them, so as it burned both in breadth and length, the churches,
public halls, Exchange, hospitals, monuments and ornaments, leaping
after a prodigious manner, from house to house, and streete to streete,
at greate distances one from y<sup>e</sup> other; for y<sup>e</sup> heat with a long set of faire
and warm weather had even ignited the aire and prepared the materials
to conceive the fire, which devour'd after an incredible manner houses,
furniture, and every thing. Here we saw the Thames cover'd with goods
floating, all the barges and boates laden with what some had time and
courage to save, as, on y<sup>e</sup> other, y<sup>e</sup> carts, &amp;c., carrying out to the fields,
which for many miles were strew'd with moveables of all sorts, and tents
erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could get away.
Oh the miserable and calamitous spectacle! Such as haply the world
had not seene since the foundation of it, nor be outdon till the universal
conflagration thereof. All the skie was of a fiery aspect, like the top
of a burning oven, and the light seene above 40 miles round about for
many nights. God grant mine eyes may never behold the like, who now
saw above 10,000 houses all in one flame; the noise and cracking and
thunder of the impetuous flames, y<sup>e</sup> shrieking of women and children,
the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses and churches was like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
hideous storme and the aire all about so hot and inflam'd that at the
last one was not able to approach it, so that they were forc'd to stand
still and let y<sup>e</sup> flames burn on, which they did neere two miles in length
and one in breadth. The clouds also of smoke were dismall and reach'd
upon computation neer 50 miles in length. Thus I left it this afternoone
burning, a resemblance of Sodom, or the last day. It forcibly call'd
to mind that passage&mdash;<i>non enim hic habemus stabilem civitatem</i>: the
ruines resembling the picture of Troy. London was, but is no more."&mdash;(Sept.
3rd, 1666.)</p></div>

<p>Can we be surprised at the bewildered feelings of the
people? Rather must we admire the practical and heroic
conduct of the homeless multitude. It took long to
rebuild the city, but directly anything could be done the
workers were up and doing.</p>

<p>An Act of Parliament was passed "for erecting a
Judicature for determination of differences touching
Houses burned or demolished by reason of the late Fire
which happened in London" (18 and 19 Car. II.,
cap. 7), and Sir Matthew Hale was the moving spirit in
the planning it and in carrying out its provisions when it
was passed. Burnet affirms that it was through his
judgment and foresight "that the whole city was raised
out of its ashes without any suits of law" (<i>History of
his Own Time</i>, Book ii.). By a subsequent Act (18 and
19 Car. II., cap. 8) the machinery for a satisfactory
rebuilding of the city was arranged. The rulings of the
judges appointed by these Acts gave general satisfaction,
and after a time the city was rebuilt very much on the
old lines, and things went on as before.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> At one time
it was supposed that the fire would cause a westward
march of trade, but the city asserted the old supremacy
when it was rebuilt.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">South-West View of Old St. Paul's.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Three great men, thoroughly competent to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
valuable advice on the rebuilding of the city, viz., Wren,
Robert Hooke, and Evelyn, presented to the King
valuable plans for the best mode of arranging the new
streets, but none of these schemes was accepted. One
cannot but regret that the proposals of the great architect
were not carried out.</p>

<p>With the reference to the Plague and the Great Fire
we may conclude this brief account of the later Stuart
London. The picturesque, but dirty, houses were
replaced by healthier and cleaner ones. The West End
increased and extended its borders, but the growth to
the north of Piccadilly was very gradual. All periods
have their chroniclers, but no period has produced such
delightful guides to the actual life of the town as the
later half of the seventeenth century did in the pages
of Evelyn and Pepys. It must ever be a sincere regret
to all who love to understand the more intimate side
of history that Pepys did not continue his <i>Diary</i> to a
later period. We must, however, be grateful for what we
possess, and I hope this slight and imperfect sketch of
Pepys's London may refresh the memories of my readers
as to what the London of that time was really like.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">At the beginning of the last century only three
bridges spanned the Thames in its course
through London, and of these two were scarcely
fifty years old; but before the century closed
there were no less than thirteen bridges across the river
between Battersea and the Pool. The three old bridges
have been rebuilt, and even some of the later ones have
been reconstructed, whilst one has been removed bodily,
and now spans the gorge of the Avon at Bristol. Of all
these bridges unfortunately only two are constructed
wholly of stone, and can lay claim to any architectural
merit; and even one of these two has recently had the
happy effect of its graceful arches destroyed by the
addition of overhanging pathways. Of the rest, some are
frankly utilitarian&mdash;mere iron girder railway bridges, with
no attempt at decoration beyond gilding the rivets&mdash;whilst
the others have their iron arches and construction
disguised with coarse and meaningless ornaments. One
only of the iron bridges is in anyway worthy of its
position; in its perfect simplicity and the bold spans
of its three arches, Southwark Bridge bears comparison
with the best in Europe, but the gradients and approaches
are so inconvenient that it is even now threatened with

</div>

<p>Exactly when the first bridge was built across the
Thames at London we can only surmise, for even tradition
is silent on the subject, and we only know of the existence
of one at an early date by very casual references, which,
however, do not help us to realise the character of the
work. Though no evidence remains of a Roman bridge,
it seems unlikely, having regard to the importance of
London, and to the fact that the great roads from the
south coast converged on a point opposite to it, on the
other side of the river, that they should have been left
to end there without a bridge to carry them over. The
difficulties of building across a great tidal river had
not prevented the Romans from bridging the Medway at
Rochester, as remains actually discovered have proved;
and if no evidences of Roman work were actually met
with in the rebuilding of London Bridge or the removal
of the old one, this may be due to the fact that each
successive bridge&mdash;and there have been at least three
within historical times&mdash;was built some distance further
up the stream than its predecessor.</p>

<p>We know, however, with certainty that a bridge was
standing in the reign of King Ethelred from the references
made to it, and we may fairly assume that this
must have been the Roman bridge, at least so far as its
main construction was concerned; and, like other Roman
bridges standing at that time in Gaul and in other parts
of England, it would have consisted merely of piers of
masonry, with a wooden roadway passing from one to
the other. It was still standing, of sufficient strength
for resistance, when the Danes under Canute sailed up
the river, who, being unable to force a passage, tradition
says&mdash;and antiquaries have imagined they could discover
traces of it&mdash;cut a ship canal through the Surrey marshes
from Bermondsey to Battersea, and passed their fleet
through that way.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">Fig. 1&mdash;The Undercroft of St. Thomas of Canterbury
on the Bridge.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The history of the bridge only opens with the
beginning of the twelfth century. According to tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
the convent of St. Mary Overie, Southwark, had been
originally endowed with the profits of a ferry across the
river, and had in consequence undertaken the duty of
maintaining the bridge in a proper state of repair when
a bridge was built. This convent was refounded in 1106
as a priory of Austin Canons; and it is not a little
remarkable, having regard to the duties it had undertaken,
that of its founders, who were two Norman Knights, one
was William de Pont de l'Arche. At the Norman town,
where stood his castle and from which he took his name,
was a bridge of twenty-two openings, erected, it was
said, by Charles the Bald, but most likely a Roman
work, across the Seine at the highest point reached by
the tide. It is a further curious coincidence that this
same William appears as a witness to a deed executed
by Henry I., excusing the manor of Alciston, in Sussex,
from paying any dues for the repairs of London Bridge.</p>

<p>It is recorded that in 1136 the bridge was burnt,
which may perhaps merely mean that the deck was
destroyed, whilst the piers remained sufficiently uninjured
to allow of the structure being repaired; but in 1163 it
had become so dangerous that Peter of Colechurch undertook
the erection of a new bridge, which he constructed
of elm timber. This sudden emergence of Peter from
obscurity to carry out so important an engineering work
is as dramatic as is that of St. Bénezet, who founded
the confraternity of <i>Hospitaliers pontifices</i>, which undertook
the building of bridges and the establishment of
ferries. According to legend, this saint, although then
only a young shepherd, essayed to bridge the Rhone
at Avignon, and the ruined arches of his great work
are still among the sights of that city. Peter may have
possessed many more qualifications for building than a
shepherd could have acquired, as large ecclesiastical
works were in progress in London throughout his life,
which he must have observed and perhaps profited by;
but this is only surmise, as of his history, except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
connection with his great work, we know no more than
the fact that he was the chaplain of St. Mary
Colechurch. His contemporary, Randulphus de Decito,
Dean of London, says that he was a native of the city, so
that it is scarcely likely that he had acquired his skill
abroad; but we are told that he traversed the country
to collect the moneys for his undertaking, and he may
thus have obtained some knowledge of the many Roman
bridges which still survived, or even have seen the great
bridge which Bishop Flambard had recently erected
across the Wear at Durham. His selection as the architect
of the earlier bridge of 1163 may perhaps not be
due in any way to his especial engineering skill, but
rather to some intimate connection with the priory of
St. Mary Overie, whose canons were primarily responsible
for the bridge repairs; indeed, since he is merely described
as the chaplain of his church, he may himself have
been one of the canons. But be the cause what it may&mdash;and
it was not his success in erecting this first bridge,
for it soon became dilapidated&mdash;thirteen years after its
erection he started afresh, on a site further up the river,
to erect a bridge of stone. In 1176, two years before
St. Bénezet began his great bridge at Avignon, he
commenced his work, and thirty-three years passed before
its completion. Whether the delay was due to lack of
funds or the incapacity of the architect we do not know,
though probably to both, for before Peter's death King
John, who had manifested considerable interest in the new
bridge, had urged Peter's dismissal, and, under the advice
of the Archbishop of Canterbury, suggested the appointment
of Isembert of Saintes to complete the work. This
Isembert was credited with the erection of the great
bridge across the Charante at Saintes, although that
bridge was undoubtedly a Roman one, and all he appears
to have done was to turn arches between the original
piers, and make it a stone bridge throughout. The same
master was said to have built another bridge at La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
Rochelle, and had evidently gained much experience in
such engineering work; and it is perhaps a misfortune
that the King's advice was neglected, as a skilled
architect, which Peter certainly was not, might have
saved the city of London much eventual loss and trouble.
Peter was, however, suffered to continue the bridge
until his death in 1205, when a commission of three
city merchants completed the work in four years.</p>

<p>The bridge which these many years of labour had
produced was in every way unsuitable to its position,
and mean as compared to similar buildings erected elsewhere.
Lacking the skill to form proper foundations,
Peter had spread them out into wide piers, which formed
an almost continuous dam, through the openings in
which the water rushed like a mill-race. The result was
that the scour soon affected the stability of the piers,
which had to be protected round by masses of masonry
and chalk in the form of sterlings, which still further
contracted the narrow waterways. The passage of the
bridge by boat&mdash;"shooting the bridge," it was called&mdash;was
always a dangerous operation; and a writer of the
last century speaks of "the noise of the falling waters,
the clamours of the water-men, and the frequent shrieks
of drowning wretches," in describing it. So imperfectly
built was the bridge that within four years of its completion
King John again interfered, and called upon the
Corporation properly to repair it; and from this time, or
perhaps from Peter's death, when the three merchants
were elected to complete the work, the Corporation
appears to have taken over the responsibility of the
bridge; and for this purpose they were endowed with
certain properties, which became the nucleus of the present
"Bridge House Estates." The increasing dilapidation of
the bridge, the debris of fallen arches, and the rubbish
and waste material which was suffered to accumulate,
still further impeded the natural flow of the water, and
little effort at improvement was ever made. Of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
widest arches of the bridge, which were called the navigable
locks, the most important had been the one nearest
to the city end, which became known as the "Rock Lock,"
and it acquired that name on account of a popular
delusion that in its fairway was a growing and vegetating
rock, which was nothing more than an accumulation of
fallen ruins, which caught and held the floating refuse
carried to and fro by the tides. And thus year after
year the river dam became more solid, and the waterfall
increased in height until it was said by one who knew
them both that it was almost as safe to attempt the
Falls of Niagara as to shoot London Bridge.</p>

<p>As years went by, not only did the waterways
become congested, but the roadway above began to be
encroached on by houses and other buildings, for which
a bridge was most unfitted. Two edifices, however, from
the first formed necessary, or at least customary, adjuncts
to such a building&mdash;the bridge gate and the bridge
chapel. It was a Roman custom to erect gates at one
end, or in the centre of their bridges&mdash;not triumphal
arches, but twin gates, such as they built to their walled
towns, and such as stood at the end of the bridge at
Saintes, when it was altered by Isembert. Such gates
as survived in mediæval times were generally fortified,
and formed the model for imitation by mediæval
builders; and such a gate was erected at the Southwark
end of London, which, under its name of Bridge Gate,
became one of the principal gates of the city. It was
erected directly on one of the main piers, and was
therefore of a substantial character, but suffered much
in the various attacks made upon London from the
Kentish side. In 1436 it collapsed, together with the
Southwark end of the bridge, but was rebuilt at the
cost of the citizens, chief among whom was Sir John
Crosby, the builder of Crosby House; and although the
gate was again in great part destroyed by the attack
on London made in 1471 by Fauconbridge, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
towers of Crosby's gate survived until the eighteenth
century. In 1577 the tower which stood at the north
end of the bridge, and on which were usually displayed
the heads of traitors, became so dilapidated that it was
taken down, and the heads then on it were transferred
to the Bridge Gate, henceforward known as "Traitors'
Gate." It was upon the earlier gate that the head of
Sir Thomas More was affixed, when heads were so
common that even his, as we know from its adventures
until buried in the Roper vault at Canterbury, was thrown
into the river to make room for a crowd of successors.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the chapel, which the founder of the bridge is
said to have erected, no account survives; and although
it was believed at the time of the destruction of the
bridge that his remains were discovered, no satisfactory
evidence of their identity was forthcoming. The first
chapel must have perished in one of the early misfortunes
which befel the fabric, as no trace of any detail
which could be referred to the thirteenth century was
discovered when the pier on which the chapel stood was
removed. The drawings made by Vertue before the
last remains were cleared away show a structure which
may be assigned to a date but little later than the
Chapel Royal of St. Stephen at Westminster, to which,
in many particulars, it must have borne a considerable
resemblance. It consisted of two storeys, both apparently
vaulted, measuring some sixty by twenty feet, with an
apsidal termination. The undercroft was nearly twenty
feet high, and our illustration (<a href="#Page_84">fig. 1</a>) of a restoration
of it, prepared from Vertue's drawings and dimensions,
will give some idea of its beauty. The upper chapel
seems to have been similar, but much more lofty, and
had an arcade running round the walls under the
windows. The buttresses of the exterior were crowned
with crocketted pinnacles, and the effect of the whole,
standing high above the surging waters of the river,
must have been as striking as it was beautiful. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
chapel was built on the centre pier of the bridge, on
the east side, and the chapels were entered from the
roadway, the lower one by a newel staircase, on which
was found the holy-water stoup when the bridge was
destroyed in the last century. At the Reformation the
church was converted into a warehouse, but, thanks to
the solidity of its construction, it remained almost
intact till it was swept away with the houses in 1756.</p>

<p>Of the other buildings on the bridge there is little
to say, for, although they made up a picturesque
composition, they were of a most flimsy character,
and wanting at the last in any architectural merit. Our
illustration (<a href="#Page_89">fig. 2</a>), taken from an oil painting by Scott,
belonging to the Fishmongers' Company, gives the
principal group on the Surrey side, and in the sixth
plate of Hogarth's <i>Marriage a la Mode</i> we get a view
through the open window of another part in the last
stage of dilapidation. There was, however, one exception
to the commonplace among them, in a timber
house, made in Holland, which was known as "Nonsuch
House." It was erected, it was said, without nails, and
placed athwart the roadway, hanging at the ends far
over the river, with towers and spires at the angles,
and over the great gate the arms of Queen Elizabeth.
The top of the main front was surmounted, at a later
date, with a pair of sundials, which bore the, for once,
appropriate motto&mdash;"Time and Tide wait for no man."</p>

<p>Had old London Bridge survived to this day, its
waterfalls would doubtless have been utilized to
generate electricity, and the idea of setting the Thames
on fire realized in lighting the streets of London by its
means; but the value of the force of the falling water
was not overlooked by our ancestors. As early as 1582
one Peter Corbis, a Dutchman, erected an engine,
worked by the stream, which lifted the water to a
reservoir, whence it was distributed by means of leaden
pipes through the city. With many alterations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
improvements, these water works continued in use until
the last century, and it was stated before the House of
Commons, in 1820, that more than 26 millions of hogsheads
of the pellucid waters of the river were thus daily
delivered to the city householders for their domestic
use.</p>

<p>Such, shortly, is the history of the fabric, which,
after enduring for more than six hundred years, was
swept away to make room for the present structure.
For any accounts of the many stirring events which
occurred on it, or about it, we have no space here. Are
they not written in the chronicles of England?</p>

<p>In the Fishmongers' Hall is preserved a valuable
memorial of the ancient structure, of which we give an
illustration (<a href="#Page_93">fig. 3</a>) by permission of the Worshipful
Company. It consists of a chair with a seat of Purbeck
marble, reminiscent in its arrangements of the coronation
chair, on which is engraved this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am the first stone that was put down for the foundation of old
London Bridge in June 1176 by a priest named Peter who was vicar of
Colechurch in London and I remained there undisturbed safe on the same
oak piles this chair is made from till the Rev<sup>d.</sup> William John Jollife
curate of Colmer Hampshire took me up in July 1832 when clearing
away the old bridge after new London Bridge was completed."</p></div>

<p>The framework of the chair gives a pictorial chronicle
of the city bridges; the top rail of the back shows old
London Bridge after the removal of the houses, below
which are new London Bridge, Southwark and old
Blackfriars Bridges. The arms of the city are carved
at the top, whilst the monogram of Peter of Colechurch
and the device of the Bridge House Estates complete
the decoration. This device, which appears to have been
also the old badge of Southwark, was sometimes displayed
upon a shield, thus:&mdash;Az., an annulet ensigned
with a cross patée, Or; interlaced with a saltire enjoined
in base, of the second. We give an illustration of this
in <a href="#Page_98">figure 5</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span></p>

<p>Westminster Bridge seems a very recent structure as
compared to that of London, but it is the next in
point of date. The growing importance of Westminster
as the seat of the Court and Parliament had made the
necessity for an approach to the south side of the
Thames, independent of the circuitous and narrow ways
of London, long apparent. In the reign of Charles II.
the question was seriously considered, to the alarm of
the Mayor and Corporation of the city, who feared that
their vested interests were endangered, and "that London
would be destroyed if carts were allowed to cross the
Thames elsewhere"; but, knowing their man, they
devoted some of their ample funds to secure that
monarch's successful opposition to the scheme. In the
middle of the eighteenth century, however, when there
was no Stuart to buy off, the idea was revived, and in
1739, one Monsieur Labelye, a Swiss engineer&mdash;English
engineers having, apparently, not sufficient experience&mdash;commenced
a new stone bridge. His mode of putting
in his foundations may have been scientific, but was
certainly simple. The bridge piers were partly built in
floating barges moored above the place where they were
to be permanently erected. The barges were then sunk,
their sides knocked out, and the piers completed. It
is needless to say that the result was not satisfactory,
and for years before the old bridge was pulled down
many of its arches were filled up with a picturesque, but
inconvenient, mass of shoring. Whether Henry, Earl
of Pembroke, who laid the foundation stone, and of whom
it was said no nobleman had a purer taste in architecture,
was in any way responsible for the design, we
cannot tell; but a French traveller of discrimination, who
criticised the work after its completion, came to the
conclusion that the peculiarly lofty parapets with which
the bridge was adorned were so designed that they might
check an Englishman's natural propensity to suicide by
giving him time for reflection while surmounting such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
obstacle. It will be noticed in our illustration (<a href="#Page_97">fig. 4</a>),
which is also taken from a painting by Scott, that the
piers are crowned by alcoves, which provided a shelter
from the blasts which blew over the river and from the
mud scattered from the roadway. These were, doubtless,
a survival of the spaces left above the cutwaters of
mediæval bridges as refuges for pedestrians from vehicles
when the roadways were very narrow, and those who
remember the old wooden bridges of Battersea and
Putney can appreciate their value.</p>

<p>The city Corporation, which had so strenuously
opposed the erection of a bridge at Westminster as
unnecessary, set to work, as soon as that became an
accomplished fact, to improve their own communications
across the river. First, as we have seen, they cleared
away the houses and other obstructions on old London
Bridge, and next they started to build themselves a new
bridge at Blackfriars. The land on both sides of the
river at the point selected was very low and most unsuitable
for the approaches, that on the north side being
close to the mouth of the Fleet ditch, which there
formed a creek large enough, in 1307, to form a haven
for ships. The new bridge was begun in 1760, from the
designs of Robert Mylne, a Scotch architect, who made
an unsuccessful attempt to give an architectural effect
to the structure by facing the piers with pairs of Ionic
columns, standing on the cutwaters. The steep gradients
of the bridge, necessitated by the lowness of the banks,
made such a decoration peculiarly unsuitable, as each
pair of columns had to be differently proportioned in
height, although the cornice over them remained of the
same depth throughout. But, in spite of its appearance
of lightness, the structure was too heavy for its
foundations, and for years this bridge rivalled that of
Westminster in the picturesqueness of its dilapidation.
The piers had been built on platforms of timber, so
that when London Bridge was rebuilt, and the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
flowed in an unchecked course, these became exposed to
the scour and were soon washed out.</p>

</div>

<p>Waterloo Bridge was completed in 1817, and still
remains unaltered and as sound as when its builders
left it. It is fortunate that the approach on the north
side was an easy one, as but a short interval occurred
between the Strand, at almost its highest point, and the
river bank, which it was easy to fill up, with the result
that the bridge passes across the river at a perfect level.
The foundations of the piers were properly constructed
by means of coffer-dams, and no sign of failure has ever
shown itself in its superstructure. The architect repeated
the use of the orders, as at Blackfriars, but with a more
fortunate result, as, the work being straight throughout,
no variations in the proportions were required, and he was
wise enough to select the Doric order as more suitable
to his purpose, and as suggesting more solidity.</p>

<p>Londoners profess to be somewhat proud of Waterloo
Bridge, and it is a tradition among them that Canova,
when he saw it, said that it was worth a journey across
Europe to see. It, therefore, seems the more incredible
that the grandchildren of those who could build such a
bridge and appreciate such a man, could have erected,
and even affect to admire, such a monstrosity as the
Tower Bridge.</p>

<p>The last of the older bridges to be built was that
of Southwark, which was the speculation of a private
company, who hoped to profit by the continuously
congested state of London Bridge; but the steepness of
the gradients and the inconvenience of the approaches
from the city made it from the first a failure. It was
the first bridge in London to be constructed in iron;
its model being the great single-span bridge across the
Wear at Sunderland. It is in three great arches, the
centre one being 240 feet across, or four feet more than
that at Sunderland, and the mass of metal is such that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
an ordinary change of temperature will raise the arches
an inch, and summer sunshine much more.</p>

<p>Of the more recent bridges there is nothing to say
worth the saying. The Thames, which was the busy and
silent highway of our forefathers, is still silent, but
busy no longer, and the appearance of its bridges is
now no one's concern, since no one sees them. So long
as they will safely carry the tramcar or the motor 'bus
from side to side, they may become uglier even than they
now are, if only that make them a little more cheap.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">These are of many kinds. We suppose they are
all more or less the lineal descendants of the
taverns and coffee-houses that we associate with
the memory of Ben Jonson, Dryden, Addison,
and Samuel Johnson.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The wits' coffee-house, where Claud Halcro carried a
parcel for Master Thimblethwaite in order to get a sight
of glorious John Dryden. Button's coffee-house, where the
"Guardian" set up his Lion's Head. The Cock and the
Cheshire Cheese, which resound with Johnson's sonorous
echoes. If, indeed, the tavern has developed into the
club, that palace of luxury, one can only say, as in the
famous transmutation of alphana to equus, "C'est diablement
changé sur la route."</p>

<p>Intermediate is the host of clubs meeting occasionally,
as the Breakfast Club, and the numerous dining clubs,
one of which, the Royal Naval Club, established in 1765,
is said to be a renewal of an earlier one dating from 1674.
"The Club," which comes down from the time of Johnson
and Reynolds, and still uses a notification to a new member
drawn up by Gibbon; the Royal Society Club; the X
Club, which consisted of ten members of the Athenæum;
the Society of Noviomagus, and the Cocked Hat Club,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
consisting of members of the Society of Antiquaries; the
Cosmos Club of the Royal Geographical Society; the
Colquhoun Club of the Royal Society of Literature; and
a host of others in connection with learned societies, most
of which are content to add the word "club" to the
name of the society. Of another, but cognate, kind is
the famous "Sublime Society of Beef Steaks," which was
founded in 1735, and died (of inanition) in 1867. The
members were not to exceed twenty-four in number. Beef
steaks were to be the only meat for dinner. The broiling
began at 2.0, and the tablecloth was removed at 3.30. In
1785 the Prince of Wales, in 1790 the Duke of York, in
1808 the Duke of Sussex, became members. It had a
laureate bard in the person of Charles Morris, elected a
member in 1785, who died in 1838 at the age of 93 years.
In early times the members appeared in the uniform of
a blue coat and buff waistcoat, with brass buttons bearing
a gridiron and the motto "Beef and Liberty." The hour
of meeting became later gradually, till in 1866 it was
fixed at 8 o'clock; then the club quickly died out.
Founded by John Rich, harlequin and machinist at
Covent Garden, it had counted among its members William
Hogarth, David Garrick, John Wilkes, John Kemble,
William Linley, Henry Brougham (Lord Chancellor), and
many other distinguished men. The Ettrick Shepherd
gave an account, in 1833, of a visit he paid to this club:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"They dine solely on beefsteaks&mdash;but what glorious beefsteaks! They
do not come up all at once&mdash;no, nor half-a-dozen times; but up they come
at long intervals, thick, tender, and as hot as fire. And during these
intervals the members sit drinking their port, and breaking their wicked
wit on each other, so that every time a new service of steaks came up,
we fell to them with much the same zest as at the beginning. The dinner
was a perfect treat&mdash;a feast without alloy."</p></div>

<p>Another somewhat similar club, though on a more
modest scale, deserves a cursory notice, inasmuch as it had
to do with a state of things that has passed away beyond
hope of recovery. About 1870 the August Society of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
the Wanderers was established with the motto, "Pransuri
vagamur." It selected all the remaining old inns at
which a dinner could be obtained, and dined at each in
succession. It also had a bard, Dr. Joseph Samuel Lavies,
and, like the Beefsteaks, has left a poetic record of its
convivialities. Of all such records, however, the salt
quickly evaporates, and it is as well to leave them
unquoted.</p>

<p>Our main object in this chapter is to state a few
incidents in the history of some of the great London clubs.
The oldest existing club appears to be White's, founded
in 1697. Boodle's, Brooks's, the Cocoa Tree, and Arthur's
date from 1762 to 1765. Most of the others belong to
the nineteenth century. The Guards' Club, which was
the first of the service clubs, dates from 1813, but that
is confined to officers of the Brigade of Guards. It was
soon, however, followed by the establishment of a club
for officers of other branches of military service.</p>

<p>We have it on good authority that before that club
was founded officers who came to London had no places
of call but the old hotels and coffee-houses. On May 31st,
1815, General Lord Lynedoch, Viscount Hill, and others
united in the establishment of a General Military Club.
On the 24th January, 1816, it was extended to the Navy,
and on the 16th February in the same year it adopted
the name of the United Service Club. On the 1st March,
1817, the foundation stone of its house in Charles Street
was laid. In November, 1828, it entered into occupation
of its present house in Pall Mall, and handed over the
Charles Street house to the Junior United Service Club.
Its premises in Pall Mall were largely extended in
1858-59, and have recently been greatly improved at a
cost of £20,000. The Club holds a lease from the Crown
to 4th January, 1964. It has a fine collection of eighty-two
pictures and busts, many of them of great merit as works
of art, others of interest as the only portraits of the
originals. The library contains several splendid portraits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
of Royal personages. The King is the patron of the
Club, and, as Prince of Wales, was a member of it. The
Prince of Wales, the Duke of Connaught, and Prince
Christian, are now members. Ten high officers of state
and persons of distinction are honorary members. Twelve
kings and thirty princes are foreign honorary members.
The number of ordinary members is 1,600, but officers
below the rank of Commander in the Royal Navy, or
Major in the Army, are not eligible. The entrance fee
is £30, and the annual subscription £10. Members have
the privilege of introducing guests. Games of hazard are
not allowed to be played, or dice to be used. Play is
not to exceed 2s. 6d. points at whist, or 10s. per hundred
at bridge.</p>

<p>As we have seen, this club shortly became full, and
a Junior United Service Club was formed in April, 1827,
on the same lines, under the patronage of the Duke of
Wellington, but admitted officers of junior rank, and in
1828 entered into occupation of the premises in Charles
Street, vacated by the Senior, on payment of £15,000. It
erected its new house in 1856 at a cost of £81,000. The
entrance fee is £40, and annual subscription eight guineas.
It was not many years after its establishment that the
list of candidates for membership of the Junior Club
became so long that the necessity for the establishment
of a third service club was felt. Sir E. Barnes and a few
officers, just returned from India, joined in the movement,
and in 1838 the Army and Navy Club was opened at
the corner of King Street and St. James's Square&mdash;the
house memorable as the scene of the party given by
Mrs. Boehm on the night the news of the Battle of
Waterloo arrived. Sir E. Barnes, who was its first
president, died the same year. In 1851 the club moved
to its present stately building, the site of which includes
that of a house granted by Charles II. on the 1st of
April, in the seventeenth year of his reign, to Nell
Gwynne, where Evelyn saw him in familiar discourse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
her. The club possesses a mirror that belonged to her,
and a portrait by Sir Peter Lely, which was supposed
to be of her, until it was discovered to be one of Louise
de Querouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, and is also rich
in pictures, statuary, and other works of art&mdash;among them,
two fine mantelpieces carved by Canova, and a miniature
of Lady Hamilton found in Lord Nelson's cabin after
his death; it has also autograph letters of Nelson and
Wellington. It derives its popular name of the "Rag
and Famish" from a tradition that Captain Duff came
late one night asking for supper, and being discontented
with the bill of fare, called it a rag and
famish affair. In memory of the event he designed
a button which used to be worn by many members,
and bore the device of a ragged man devouring
a bone. Napoleon III. was an honorary member of the
club, and frequently used it. He presented it with a fine
piece of Gobelin tapestry in 1849. The regular number
of members is 2,400. The club has a scheme for granting
annuities or pensions to its servants.</p>

<p>Of the group of social clubs bearing names derived
from the original proprietors of the club-houses&mdash;as
White's, Boodle's, Brooks's, and Arthur's&mdash;Brooks's may
be taken as a specimen. A roll of its members from the
date of its foundation in 1764 to 1900 has recently been
published under the title <i>Memorials of Brooks's</i>, and
contains much interesting information. The editors,
Messrs. V. A. Williamson, S. Lyttelton and S. Simeon,
state that the first London Clubs were instituted with the
object of providing the world of fashion with a central
office for making wagers, and a registry for recording
them. In their early days gambling was unlimited.
Brooks's was not political in its origin. The twenty-seven
original members included the Dukes of Roxburgh,
Portland, and Gordon. In the 136 years 3,465 members
have been admitted.</p>

<p>The original house was on or near the site of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
present Marlborough Club, and Almack was the first
manager or master. About 1774 he was succeeded by
Brooks, from whom the club derives its name. He died
in 1782, and was succeeded by one Griffin. In 1795 the
system was altered, and six managers were appointed.
The present house in St. James' Street was constructed
in 1889-90, when 2, Park Place, was incorporated with it.
The entrance fee in 1791 was five guineas, and was raised
successively in 1815, 1881, 1892, and 1901, to nine, fifteen,
twenty-five and thirty guineas. The subscription was at
first four guineas, raised in 1779 to eight guineas, and in
1791 to ten guineas.</p>

<p>An offshoot of Brooks's is the Fox Club, a dining club,
probably a continuation of an earlier Whig Club. Up
to 1843 it met at the Clarendon Hotel, and since then at
Brooks's. It is said to have been constituted for the
purpose of paying Fox's debts, for which his friends, in
1793, raised £70,000. Sir Augustus Keppel Stephenson
was the secretary of this club from 1867 until his death
in 1904. He was the son of a distinguished member of
Brooks's, who had joined that club in 1818, the Fox
Club in 1829, was secretary of the Sublime Society of
Beef Steaks, and the last man to wear Hessian boots.</p>

<p>The Travellers' Club dates from 1819, the Union from
1821, and the United University from 1822.</p>

<p>The Union Club is composed of noblemen, members
of Parliament, and gentlemen of the first distinction and
character who are British subjects, and has 1,250 members.
Election is by open voting in the committee. Foreign
and Colonial persons of distinction may be made
temporary honorary members. The entrance fee is
twenty-one guineas; the annual subscription ten guineas.</p>


<p>The United University Club has 1,000 members, of
whom 500 belong to Oxford and 500 to Cambridge. The
King is a member. Cabinet ministers, bishops, judges,
etc., may be admitted without ballot. All members of
either University are qualified to be candidates, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
graduates, persons who have resided in college or hall
for two years, holders of honorary degrees, and students
in civil law of above three years' standing, are qualified
to be members. The club has recently rebuilt its house
at the corner of Suffolk Street and Pall Mall East.</p>

<p>The Athenæum was originated by Mr. John Wilson
Croker, after consultation with Sir Humphry Davy,
president of the Royal Society, and was founded in 1824
for the association of individuals known for their scientific
or literary attainments, artists of eminence in any class
of the fine arts, and noblemen and gentlemen distinguished
as liberal patrons of science, literature, or the arts. It
is essential to the maintenance of the Athenæum, in
conformity with the principles upon which it was originally
founded, that the annual introduction of a certain number
of persons of distinguished eminence in science, literature,
or the arts, or for public services, should be secured.
Accordingly, nine persons of such qualifications are
elected by the committee each year. The club entrusts
this privilege to the committee, in the entire confidence
that they will only elect persons who shall have attained
to distinguished eminence in science, literature, or the arts,
or for public services. The General Committee may also
elect princes of the blood Royal, cabinet ministers,
bishops, speakers of the House of Commons, judges, and
foreign ambassadors, or ministers plenipotentiary of not
less than three years' residence at the Court of St. James's,
to be extraordinary members; and may invite, as honorary
members during temporary residence in England, the
heads of foreign missions, foreign members of the Royal
Society, and not more than fifteen other foreigners or
colonists of distinction. The ordinary members of the
club are 1,200 in number. The entrance fee is thirty
guineas, and the annual subscription eight guineas. The
presidents for the time being of the Royal Society, of
the Society of Antiquaries, and of the Royal Academy
of Arts, if members, are ex-officio members of the General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
Committee. An Executive Committee of nine is selected
from the General Committee to manage the domestic and
other ordinary affairs of the club. No elected member
can remain on the General Committee more than three
consecutive years, unless he is a member of the Executive
Committee, in which case he may be re-elected for a
second term of three years. No higher stake than half-a-guinea
points shall be played for. No game of mere
chance shall be played in the house for money. No
member shall make use of the club as an address in any
advertisement.</p>

<p>The history of the club has been told by the Rev.
J. G. Waugh in an interesting book printed for private
circulation in 1900. Its first house was 12, Waterloo
Place, where it remained until 1827, when it obtained its
present site. Its success was so great that within four
months of the preliminary meeting in 1824 it had a list
of 506 members, including the then Prime Minister and
seven persons who afterwards became Prime Ministers.
By 1827 it was full, and had a list of 270 candidates
waiting for election. The present house was planned by
Decimus Burton, and an attic storey was added to it in
1899-1900. It is a successful building, striking attention
by the statue of Minerva over the porch, the frieze, and
the noble hall and grand staircase. The hall was re-decorated
in 1891 under the direction of Sir L. Alma
Tadema. Originally, a soirée was held every Wednesday,
to which ladies were admitted. That has long been discontinued,
and, as a satirical member observed, "Minerva
is kept out in the cold, while her owls are gorging within."
Among the members of the club have been the following
great actors: Macready, Mathews, Kemble, Terry, Kean,
Young, and Irving.</p>

<p>The Oriental Club was also established in 1824, at
a meeting held eight days after that at which the
Athenæum had been established. Sir John Malcolm
presided. The club was intended for the benefit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
persons who had been long resident abroad in the service
of the Crown, or of the East India Company. By May,
1826, it had 928 members, and in that year it took
possession of the site of 18, Hanover Square, and employed
Mr. B. D. Wyatt as the architect of its house. Its history
has been written by Mr. Alexander F. Baillie, in a book
published in 1901. Mr. Wyatt provided a grand staircase,
but no smoking-room, and only one billiard-room.
At that time and until 1842 the club provided its members
gratuitously with snuff at a cost of £25 per year. In 1874
the present smoking-room was opened; and now the
handsome drawing-room is a place where those can retire
who desire solitude, and the smoking-room and billiard-rooms
are overcrowded. The club has a fine library.
It claims among its members the prototype of Colonel
Newcome. The members have a custom of securing a
table for dinner by inverting a plate upon it.</p>

<p>In 1855 the Oriental Club agreed to take over, without
entrance fee, the members of the Alfred Club, which had
been established in 1808, and was then being dissolved.
Nearly 400 members availed themselves of the
offer. The history of that club has some points of
interest. It was largely intended for literary men, but
it is said that Canning, vexed at overhearing a member
asking who he was, gave it the nickname of the "Half-read"
Club, which stuck to it. Its early career was
prosperous, and by 1811 it had 354 candidates
and only six vacancies; but its popularity waned.
The real cause of its dissolution was the firm
conservatism of the committee. They would not
recognise the growing demand of accommodation for
smokers. The clubhouse, No. 23, Albemarle Street, had
been built and arranged in the days when no such
accommodation had been considered necessary, and the
committee resolutely refused to make any concession
to the members who desired to smoke.</p>

<p>The Garrick Club was founded in 1831. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
instituted for the general patronage of the drama; for
the purpose of combining the use of a club on economical
principles with the advantage of a literary society; for
bringing together the supporters of the drama; and for
the foundation of a national library, with works on
costume. The number of members is limited to 650,
who pay an entrance fee of twenty guineas, and an annual
subscription of ten guineas. The club is more than
usually hospitable, as it allows a member to invite three
visitors to dinner, and admits the public to see its
magnificent collection of dramatic pictures daily from
10 to 1.</p>

<p>The Carlton Club was established in 1832. It is
famous as the rallying ground for the Conservative party,
the temple of Toryism. From it, and its resources,
candidates in that interest derive much encouragement
and support, and it may not unreasonably be inferred that
some of that encouragement and support is material as
well as moral.</p>

<p>The Reform Club was established in 1837, and then
held the same position towards the Liberal party. It
was instituted for the purpose of promoting the social
intercourse of the Reformers of the United Kingdom.
All candidates are to declare themselves to be reformers,
but no definition of a "reformer" is given. If, however,
a member is believed not to be a reformer, fifty members
may call a general meeting for his expulsion. Members
of Parliament and peers may be admitted by general
ballot, with priority of election. The committee elect
each year two gentlemen of distinguished eminence for
public service, or in science, literature, or arts. The
Political Committee of fifty members elect each year
two persons who have proved their attachment to the
Liberal cause by marked and obvious services. Other
members are elected by general ballot, one black
ball in ten excluding. The club has 1,400 members. It
has a fine library. It has liberal regulations as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
admission of guests, and ladies may be admitted to view
the club from 11.0 a.m. to 5.0 p.m. Members may inspect
the books and accounts and take extracts from them.
The admission fee is £40, and the annual subscription
ten guineas.</p>

<p>The Conservative Club was established in 1840, and
the National Club in 1845. The object of the National
Club is to promote Protestant principles, and to encourage
united action among Protestants in political and social
questions by establishing a central organisation to obtain
and spread information on such questions, by affording
facilities for conference thereon, and by providing in the
metropolis a central place of meeting to devise the fittest
means for promoting the object in view. Its members
must hold the doctrines and principles of the reformed
faith, as revealed in Holy Scripture, asserted at the
Reformation, and generally embodied in the Articles of
the Church of England. It has a general committee,
house committee, library committee, prayer and religious
committee, wine committee, finance committee, and
Parliamentary committee. The General Committee has
power to elect as honorary members of the club not
more than twenty persons distinguished by their zeal and
exertions on behalf of the Protestant cause; these are
mostly clergymen. All meetings of committees are to
be opened with prayer. The household are to attend the
reading of the Word of God and prayers morning and
evening in the committee room. The Parliamentary
committee are to watch all proceedings in Parliament and
elsewhere affecting the Protestant principles of the club.
Its fundamental principles are declared to be:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) The maintenance of the Protestant constitution,
succession, and faith.</p>

<p>(2) The recognition of Holy Scripture in national
education.</p>

<p>(3) The improvement of the moral and social
condition of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span></p></div>

<p>The club is singular in having these definite religious
purposes, and no doubt has in its time done much for
the Protestant cause; but there is a little incongruity
between the earnestness of its purpose and the self-indulgence
which club life almost necessarily implies;
and religious opinion, which claims to be the most stable
of all things, is really one of the most fluid. Most men,
who think at all, pass through many phases of it in their
lives. It would not be surprising if this early earnestness
had somewhat cooled down.</p>

<p>Another group of clubs consists of those the
members of which are bound together by a common
interest in some athletic sport or pursuit&mdash;as the Marylebone
Cricket Club, which dates from 1787; the Alpine
Club, which was founded in 1857; the Hurlingham Club,
in 1868; and to these may perhaps be added, as approximating
to the same class, the Bath Club, 1894.</p>

<p>The gradual filling up of old clubs, which we observed
in the case of the service clubs, and the congested state
of their lists of candidates, leading to long delay before
an intending member had the chance of election, has led
to the establishment of junior clubs; thus, in 1864, the
Junior Athenæum and the Junior Carlton were founded.</p>

<p>A further development has been the establishment
of clubs for women. The Albemarle Club, founded in
1874, admits both men and women, and adjusts its lists
of candidates so as to provide for the election of nearly
equal numbers of both.</p>

<p>The Marlborough Club should also be mentioned
specially, as it was founded by the King, and no person
can be admitted a member except upon His Majesty's
special approval.</p>

<p>The Authors' Club was established in 1891 by the
late Sir Walter Besant, and is especially noted for its
house dinners, at which some person of distinction is
invited to be the guest of the club.</p>

<p>Altogether, the clubs of London are very numerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
and we have only been able to draw attention to
the peculiarities of a few of them. Like every other
human institution, they are subject to continual
change, and there are pessimists who go about saying
that they are decaying and losing their popularity
and their usefulness. The long lists of candidates
on the books of the principal clubs do not lend much
colour to this suggestion. Social habits alter with every
generation of men, and it is possible that many men do
not use their clubs in the same way that the founders
did, but the fact remains that they do use them, and that
clubs still form centres of pleasure and convenience to
many.</p>

<p>One particular in which the change of social habits
is especially noticeable is with respect to gaming. This,
as we have seen, was almost the <i>raison d'être</i> of some
of the early clubs, and there are numerous tales of the
recklessness with which it was pursued, and the fortunes
lost and won at the gaming table. We have quoted from
one or two clubs the regulations which now prevail, and
similar regulations are adopted in most of the other clubs.
Games of chance are wholly prohibited; and limits are
provided to the amount that may be staked on games of
cards. Each club has also a billiard room.</p>

<p>With respect to smoking, the habitués of clubs have
experienced a great change. Formerly the smoking
room, if any, was small and far away; now the luxury
of the club is concentrated in it, and the question is
rather in what rooms smoking is not to be allowed. Very
few clubs retain the old tradition that smoking is a thing
to be discouraged and kept out of sight.</p>

<p>Other signs of change are the increase in the cost
of membership and the later hours for dining. It need
hardly be said that the clubs pay great attention to their
kitchens. We have it on the authority of Major A.
Griffiths (<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, April, 1907) that the
salary of the chef is between £200 and £300 a year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

<p>The customs of the clubs with regard to the admission
of visitors vary. At one end of the scale is the Athenæum,
which will not allow its members to give a stranger even
a cup of cold water, and allows of conversation with
strangers only in the open hall or in a small room by the
side of the doorway. At the other end are clubs which
provide special rooms for the entertainment of visitors,
and encourage their members to treat their friends
hospitably, and to show them what the club is able to
do in the matter of cooking and wines.</p>

<p>The social ethics of clubs vary in like manner. In
some clubs, notably those of the Bohemian type, but
including several which would claim not to belong to that
group, mere membership of the club is a sufficient
introduction to justify a member in addressing another,
and conversation in the common rooms of the club
becomes general. This is delightful&mdash;within limits: it
is not always possible to create by the atmosphere of the
club a sentiment that will restrain all its members from
sometimes overstepping those bounds of mutual courtesy
and consideration which alone can make such general
conversation altogether pleasant. The greater clubs go
to the opposite extreme, and members of them may meet
day after day for many years in perfect unconsciousness
of the existence of each other; yet, even in these, the
association of those who know each other outside the
club, but without its opportunities would rarely meet,
though they have similar interests and pursuits, is a very
desirable and useful thing. Many an excellent measure,
originating in the mind of one member, has been matured
by conversation with others, to the general good. So may
the Clubs of London continue to prosper and flourish.</p></div>

<p class='p3'><span class="smcap">By Philip Norman, LL.D.</span></p>



<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.png" width="100" height="118" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">To write a detailed account of London inns and
houses of entertainment generally would
require not a few pages, but several volumes.
The inns, first established to supply the modest
wants of an unsophisticated age, came by degrees to fulfil
the functions of our modern hotels, railway stations, and
parcel offices; they were places of meeting for business
and social entertainment&mdash;in short, they formed a
necessary part of the life of all Londoners, and of all
who resorted to London, except the highest and the lowest.
The taverns, successors of mediæval cook-shops, were
frequented by most of the leading spirits of each
generation from Elizabethan times to the early part
of the nineteenth century, and their place has now been
taken by clubs and restaurants. About these a mass of
information is available, also on coffee-houses, a development
of the taverns, in which, for the most part, they were
gradually merged. As to the various forms of public-house,
their whimsical signs alone have amused literary
men, and perhaps their readers, from the time of <i>The
Spectator</i> until now. In this chapter I propose to confine
my remarks to the inns "for receipt of travellers," so
often referred to by John Stow in his <i>Survey of London</i>,
which, largely established in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, continued on the same sites, mostly until years
after the advent of railways had caused a social revolution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
These inns, with rare exceptions, had a galleried
courtyard, a plan of building also common on the
Continent, which came perhaps originally from the East.
In such courtyards, as we shall see, during Tudor times
theatrical performances often took place, and in form
they probably gave a hint to the later theatres.</p>

<p>Before the fifteenth century it was usual for
travellers to seek the hospitality of religious houses, the
great people being lodged in rooms set apart for them,
while the poorer sort found shelter in the guest-house.
But as time went on this proved inadequate, and inns on
a commercial basis came into existence, being frequented
by those who could hardly demand special consideration
from the religious houses, and were not fitting recipients
of charity. Naturally enough, these inns, when once their
usefulness became recognised, were soon to be found in
the main thoroughfares leading out of the metropolis, and
they were particularly plentiful in Southwark on each side
of what we now call the Borough High Street, extending
for a quarter of a mile or more from London Bridge along
the main road to the south-eastern counties and the
Continent. The first thus established, and one of the
earliest in this country, had to some extent a religious
origin&mdash;namely, the</p>

<span class="i20">"Gentle hostelrye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hight the Tabard, fasté by the Belle,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>about which and about the Southwark inns generally I
propose now to say a few words, for although well known,
they are of such extreme interest that they demand a
foremost place in an account of this kind. From the
literary point of view the "Tabard" is immortalized, owing
to the fact that Chaucer has selected it as the starting-point
of his pilgrims in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. Historically,
it may be mentioned that as early as the year 1304 the
Abbot and Convent of Hyde, near Winchester, purchased
in Southwark two tenements, on the sites of which he
built for himself a town dwelling, and at the same time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
it is believed, a hostelry for the convenience of travellers.
In 1307 he obtained license to build a chapel at or by
the inn, and in a later deed we are told that "the abbott's
lodginge was wyninge to the backside of the Tabarde
and had a garden attached." From that time onwards
frequent allusions can be found to this house, the sign
of which (a sleeveless coat, such as that worn by heralds)
got somehow corrupted into the Talbot, a species of dog,
by which it was known for a couple of centuries or more,
almost to the time of its final destruction. Although the
contrary has been asserted, the inn was undoubtedly burnt
in the Great Southwark Fire of 1676, but was rebuilt
soon afterwards in the old fashion, and continued to be
a picturesque example of architecture until 1875, when
the whole was swept away, hop merchants' offices and
a modern "old Tabard" now occupying the site.</p>

<p>Equal in interest to the last-named inn was the "White
Hart." At the one Chaucer gave life and reality to a
fancied scene; at the other occurred an historical event,
the bald facts of which Shakespeare has lighted up with
a halo of romance. The White Hart appears to have
dated from the latter part of the fourteenth century,
the sign being a badge of Richard II., derived from his
mother, Joan of Kent. In the summer of 1450 it was
Jack Cade's headquarters while he was striving to gain
possession of London. Hall, in his <i>Chronicle</i>, records this,
and adds that he prohibited "murder, rape and robbery by
which colour he allured to him the hartes of the common
people." It was here, nevertheless, that "one Hawaydyne
of sent Martyns was beheaded," and here, during
the outbreak, a servant of Sir John Fastolf, who had
property in the neighbourhood, was with difficulty saved
from assassination. His chattels were pillaged, his wife
left with "no more gode but her kyrtyll and her smook,"
and he thrust into the forefront of a fight then raging
on London Bridge, where he was "woundyd and hurt
nere hand to death." Cade's success was of short duration;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
his followers wavered, he said, or might have said, in the
words attributed to him by Shakespeare (2 Henry VI.,
act iv., scene 8), "Hath my sword therefore broken
through London gate that you should leave me at the
White Hart in Southwark?" The rebellion collapsed,
and our inn is not heard of for some generations. Want
of space prevents our recording the various vicissitudes
through which it passed, and the historic names connected
with it, until the time of the Southwark Fire of 1676,
when, like the "Tabard," it was burnt down, but rebuilt
on the old foundations. In 1720 Strype describes it as
large and of considerable trade, and it so continued until
the time when Dickens, who was intimately acquainted
with the neighbourhood, gave his graphic description of
Sam Weller at the White Hart in the tenth chapter of
<i>Pickwick</i>. In 1865-66 the south side of the building was
replaced by a modern tavern, but the old galleries on
the north and east sides remained until 1889, being
latterly let out in tenements.</p>

<p>There were several other galleried inns in Southwark,
dating at least from the time of Queen Elizabeth, which
survived until the nineteenth century, but we only have
space briefly to allude to three. The "King's Head" and
the "Queen's Head" was each famous in its way. The
former had been originally the "Pope's Head," the sign
being changed at the Reformation. In 1534 the Abbot
of Waverley, whose town house was not far off, writes,
apparently on business, that he will be at the "Pope's
Head" in Southwark&mdash;eight years afterwards it appears
as the "King's Head." In a deed belonging to Mr. G. Eliot
Hodgkin, F.S.A., the two names are given. In the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the house belonged
to various noteworthy people; among the rest, to Thomas
Cure, a local benefactor, and to Humble, Lord Ward. It
was burnt in the Great Southwark Fire, and the last
fragment of the galleried building, erected immediately
afterwards, was pulled down in January, 1885.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span></p>

<p>The "Queen's Head" was the only one of the
Southwark houses we are describing that escaped the
Fire of 1676, perhaps owing to the fact that, by way
of precaution, a tenement was blown up at the gateway.
It stood on the site of a house called the "Crowned
or Cross Keys," which in 1529 was an armoury or
store-place for the King's harness. In 1558 it had a
brew-house attached to it, and had lately been rebuilt.
In 1634 the house had become the "Queen's Head," and
the owner was John Harvard, of Emmanuel College,
Cambridge, who afterwards migrated to America, and
gave his name to Harvard University, Massachusetts.
About this time it was frequented by carriers, as we learn
from John Taylor, "the water-poet." The main building,
destroyed in 1895, was found to be of half-timbered
construction, dating perhaps from the sixteenth century.
A galleried portion, also of considerable age, survived
until the year 1900.</p>

<p>Of another Southwark inn, the "George," we can
fortunately speak in the present tense. It seems to have
come into existence in the early part of the sixteenth
century, and is mentioned with the sign of "St. George"
in 1554:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"St. George that swindg'd the Dragon, and e'er since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The owner in 1558 was Humfrey Colet, or Collet, who
had been Member of Parliament for Southwark. Soon
after the middle of the seventeenth century, in a book
called <i>Musarum Deliciæ, or the Muses' Recreation</i>, compiled
by Sir John Mennes (Admiral and Chief Comptroller
of the Navy) and Dr. James Smith, appeared some lines,
"upon a surfeit caught by drinking bad sack at 'the
George' in Southwark." Perhaps the landlord mended
his ways; in any case, the rent was shortly afterwards
£150 a year&mdash;a large sum for those days. The "George"
was a great coaching and carriers' inn. Only a fragment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
of it, but a picturesque one, now exists; it is still galleried,
and dates from shortly after the Southwark Fire of 1676.
The rest of the building was pulled down in 1889-90.
All the inns to which allusion has been made were
clustered together on the east side of the Borough High
Street, the gateways of those most distant from each
other being only about 140 yards apart.</p>

<p>Another leading thoroughfare from London to the
east was the road through Aldgate to Whitechapel. Here,
though the houses of entertainment were historically far
less interesting than those of Southwark, they flourished
for many years. Where a modern hotel with the same
sign now stands, next to the Metropolitan railway station
on the north side of Aldgate High Street, there was once
a well-known inn, the "Three Nuns," so called, perhaps,
from the contiguity of the nuns of St. Clare, or <i>sorores
minores</i>, who gave a name to the Minories. The
"Three Nuns" inn is mentioned by Defoe in his <i>Journal
of the Plague</i>, which, though it describes events that
happened when he was little more than an infant, has
an air of authenticity suggesting personal experience.
We are told by him that near this inn was the "dreadful
gulf&mdash;for such it was rather than a pit"&mdash;in which, during
the Plague of 1665, not less than 1,114 bodies were buried
in a fortnight, from the 6th to the 20th of September.
Throughout the eighteenth and the early part of the
nineteenth centuries this house was much frequented by
coaches and carriers. The late Mr. Edwin Edwards, who
etched it in 1871, was told by the landlord that a four-horse
coach was then running from there to Southend
during the summer months. A painting of the holy nuns
still appeared on the sign-board. The house was rebuilt
soon after the formation of the Metropolitan Railway.
A short distance west of the "Three Nuns," at 31, Aldgate
High Street, the premises of Messrs. Adkin and Sons,
wholesale tobacconists, occupy the site of the old "Blue
Boar" coaching inn, which they replaced in 1861. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
sculptured sign of the "Blue Boar," let into the wall
in front, was put up at the time of the rebuilding. The
former inn, described on a drawing in the Crace collection
as the oldest in London, is held by some to be the same
as that referred to in an order of the Privy Council to
the Lord Mayor, dated from St. James's, September 5th,
1557, wherein he is told to "apprehende and to comitt
to safe warde" certain actors who are about to perform
in "a lewde Playe called a Sacke full of Newse" at
the "Boar's Head" without Aldgate.</p>

<p>A few years ago, at No. 25, the entrance might still
be seen of another famous inn called the "Bull," formerly
the "Black Bull." Above the gateway was a fine piece
of ironwork, and the old painted sign was against the
wall of the passage. This house flourished greatly a
little before the advent of railways, when Mrs. Anne
Nelson, coach proprietor, was the landlady, and could
make up nearly two hundred beds there. Most of her
business was to Essex and Suffolk, but she also owned
the Exeter coach. She must have been landlady on the
memorable occasion when Mr. Pickwick arrived in a cab
after "two mile o' danger at eightpence," and it was
through this very gateway that he and his companions
were driven by the elder Weller when they started on
their adventurous journey to Ipswich. The house is now
wholly destroyed and the yard built over.</p>

<p>A common sign in former days was the "Saracen's
Head." We shall have occasion to refer to several in
London. One of them stood by Aldgate, just within
the limits of the city. Here a block of old buildings
is in existence on the south side, which once formed
the front of a well-known coaching inn, with this sign.
The spacious inn yard remains, the house on the east
side of its entrance having fine pilasters. From the
"Saracen's Head," Aldgate, coaches plied to Norwich as
long ago as 1681, and here there is, or was quite recently,
a carrier's booking office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span></p>

<p>Another thoroughfare which, within the memory of
some who hardly admit that they are past middle age, contained
several famous inns, was that leading to the north,
and known in its various parts as Gracechurch Street and
Bishopsgate Street Within and Without. One of the best
known was the "Cross Keys" in Bishopsgate Street, mentioned
in the preface to Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i> as a house
at which theatrical performances took place. It was here
that, in the latter part of the sixteenth century, Bankes
exhibited the extraordinary feats of his horse Marocco.
One of them, if we may believe an old jest-book, was
to select and draw forth Tarlton with its mouth as "the
veriest fool in the company." In more modern times, until
the advent of railways, the "Cross Keys" was a noted
coaching and carriers' establishment. Destroyed in the
Great Fire, and again burnt down in 1734, but rebuilt in
the old style, it was still standing on the west side of the
street, immediately south of Bell Yard, when Larwood and
Hotten published their <i>History of Signboards</i> in 1866.
Another inn with this sign stood appropriately near the
site of St. Peter's Church in Wood Street, Cheapside,
and was pulled down probably about the same time as
the more famous house in Gracechurch Street.</p>

<p>Of equal note was the "Spread Eagle," the site of
which has mostly been absorbed by the extension of
Leadenhall Market. Like the "Cross Keys," it was burnt
in the Great Fire, but rebuilt in the old style with an
ample galleried yard. In the basement some mediæval
arches still remained. At the "Spread Eagle" that
original writer George Borrow had been staying with
his future wife, Mrs. Mary Clarke, and various friends,
when they were married at St. Peter's Church, Cornhill,
on April 23rd, 1840, her daughter, Henrietta, signing the
register. Before its destruction in 1865 it had been for
some time a receiving office of Messrs. Chaplin and Horne.
The site, of about 1,200 square feet, was sold for no
less a sum than £95,000. Another Gracechurch inn, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
"Tabard," which long ago disappeared, had, like the
immortal hostelry in Southwark, become the "Talbot,"
and its site is marked by Talbot Court.</p>

<p>In Bishopsgate Street Within three galleried inns
lingered long enough to have been often seen by the
writer. These were the "Bull," the "Green Dragon,"
and the "Four Swans," each with something of a history,
and to them might be added the picturesque, though less
important, "Vine" and the "Flower Pot," from which
last house a seventeenth century trade token was issued.
The "Bull," the most southern of these inns, all of which
were on the west side of the highway, was at least as
old as the latter part of the fifteenth century, for in
one of the chronicles of London lately edited by
Mr. C. L. Kingsford, I find it, under the date 1498,
associated with a painful incident&mdash;namely, the execution
of the son of a cordwainer, "dwellyng at the Bulle in
Bisshoppesgate Strete," for calling himself the Earl of
Warwick. Hall gives his name as Ralph Wilford.
Anthony Bacon, elder brother of Francis, during the year
1594 hired a lodging in Bishopsgate Street, but the fact
of its being near the "Bull," where plays and interludes
were performed, so troubled his mother that for
her sake he removed to Chelsea. Shortly afterwards,
as may be learnt from <i>Tarlton's Jests</i>, the old drama
called "The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth" was
here played, "wherein the judge was to take a boxe on
the eare, and because he was absent that should take
the blow, Tarlton himselfe, ever forward to please, tooke
upon him to play the judge, besides his own part of
the clown." The "Bull" was the house of call of old
Hobson, the carrier, to whose rigid rule about the letting
of his saddle horses we are supposed to owe the phrase,
"Hobson's Choice." Milton wrote his epitaph in the well-known
lines beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lies old Hobson; Death hath broke his girt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here, alas! hath laid him in the dirt."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his second edition of <i>Milton's Poems</i>, p. 319, Wharton
alludes to Hobson's "portrait in fresco" as having then
lately been in existence at the inn, and it is mentioned
in <i>The Spectator</i>, No. 509. There is a print of it representing
a bearded old man in hat and cloak with a money
bag, which in the original painting had the inscription,
"The fruitful mother of an hundred more." He
bequeathed property for a conduit to supply Cambridge
with water; the conduit head still exists, though not in
its original position. In 1649, by a Council of War,
six Puritan troopers were condemned to death for a
mutiny at the "Bull." The house remained till 1866.</p>

<p>Further north, at No. 86, was the "Green Dragon,"
the last of the galleried inns that survived in Bishopsgate
Street. It is mentioned in De Laune's <i>Present State of
London</i>, 1681, as a place of resort for coachmen and
carriers, and I have before me an advertisement sheet
of the early nineteenth century, showing that coaches
were then plying from here to Norwich, Yarmouth,
Cambridge, Colchester, Ware, Hertford, Brighton, and
many other places. There is a capital etching of the
house by Edwin Edwards. It was closed in 1877, its
site being soon afterwards built over. At the sale of the
effects eleven bottles of port wine fetched 37s. 6d. each.
The "Four Swans," immediately to the north of the inn
last named, although it did not survive so long, remained
to the end a more complete specimen of its class, having
three tiers of galleries perfect on each side, and two
tiers at the west end. The "water-poet" tells us that
in 1637 "a waggon or coach" came here once a week
from Hertford. Other references to it might be quoted
from books of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
but the story told on an advertisement sheet issued by
a former landlord about a fight here between Roundheads,
led by Ireton, and a troop of Royalists, is apocryphal.</p>

<p>Not far off, in Bishopsgate Street Without, there
was until lately a "Two Swan" inn yard, and a "One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
Swan" with a large yard&mdash;an old place of call for carriers
and waggons. These lingered on until the general clearance
by the Great Eastern Railway Company a few
years ago, when the remains of Sir Paul Pindar's mansion,
latterly a tavern, were also removed; the finely-carved
timber front and a stuccoed ceiling finding their way into
the Victoria and Albert Museum. Another old Bishopsgate
house was the "White Hart," near St. Botolph's
Church, a picturesque building with projecting storeys,
and in front the date 1480, but the actual structure was
probably much less ancient. It was drawn by J. T. Smith
and others early in the nineteenth century, and did not
long survive. The site is still marked by White Hart
Court. On the opposite side of the way was an inn,
the "Dolphin," which, as Stow tells us, was given in
1513 by Margaret Ricroft, widow, with a charge in favour
of the Grey Friars. It disappeared in the first half of
the eighteenth century. The old "Catherine Wheel,"
a galleried inn hard by, mentioned by De Laune in 1681,
was not entirely destroyed till 1894.</p>

<p>Another road out of London richly furnished with
inns was that from Newgate westward. The first one
came to was the "Saracen's Head" on Snow Hill, an
important house, to which the late Mr. Heckethorn
assigned a very early origin. Whether or not it existed
in the fourteenth century, as he asserts, it was certainly
flourishing when Stow in his <i>Survey</i> described it as "a
fair and large inn for receipt of travellers." It continued
for centuries to be largely used, and here Nicholas
Nickleby and his uncle waited on Squeers, the Yorkshire
schoolmaster, whom Dickens must have modelled from
various real personages. In a <i>Times</i> advertisement for
January 3rd, 1801, I read that "at Mr. Simpson's
Academy, Wodencroft Lodge, near Greta Bridge, Yorkshire,
young gentlemen are boarded and accurately
instructed in the English, Latin, and Greek languages,
writing, arithmetic, merchants' accounts, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
useful branches of the mathematics, at 16 guineas per
annum, if under nine years of age, and above that age
17 guineas; French taught by a native of France at
1 guinea extra. Mr. Simpson is now in town, and may
be treated with from eleven till two o'clock every day at
the 'Saracen's Head,' Snow Hill." In the early part
of last century the landlady was Sarah Ann Mountain,
coach proprietor, and worthy rival of Mrs. Nelson,
of the "Bull" Inn, Aldgate. The "Saracen's Head"
disappeared in the early part of 1868, when this neighbourhood
was entirely changed by the formation of
the Holborn Viaduct. Another Snow Hill inn was the
"George," or "George and Dragon," mentioned by
Strype as very large and of considerable trade. A
sculptured sign from there is in the Guildhall Museum.</p>

<p>In Holborn there were once nine or ten galleried inns.
We will only allude to those still in existence within the
memory of the writer. The most famous of them,
perhaps, was the "George and Blue Boar," originally the
"Blue Boar," the site of which is covered by the Inns
of Court Hotel. The house is named in the burial
register of St. Andrew's, Holborn, as early as 1616, but
it is chiefly known from a story related by the Rev.
Thomas Morrice, in his <i>Memoir of Roger Earl of Orrery</i>
(1742), that Cromwell and Ireton, in the disguise of
troopers, here intercepted a letter sewn in the flap of
a saddle from Charles I. to his Queen, in which he wrote
that he was being courted by the Scotch Presbyterians
and the army, and that he thought of closing with the
former. Cromwell is supposed to have said, "From that
time forward we resolved on his ruin." The writer
ventured to ask that excellent historian, Dr. Samuel
Gardiner, what he thought of the statement. In August,
1890, he most kindly replied by letter as follows:&mdash;"The
tale has generally been repudiated without enquiry, and
I am rather inclined to believe, at least, in its substantial
accuracy. The curious thing is, that there are two lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
of tradition about intercepted letters, as it seems to me
quite distinct." We may, therefore, without being over
credulous, cherish the belief that the picturesque incident
referred to was one that actually occurred. There is an
advertisement of December 27th, 1779, offering the lease
of the "George and Blue Boar," which helps us to realize
the value and capacity of an important inn of that period.
We are told that it contains forty bedrooms, stabling for
fifty-two horses, seven coach-houses, and a dry ride sixty
yards long; also that it returns about £2,000 a year.
In George Colman the younger's "Heir at Law," act i.,
scene 2, this house is said by one of the characters to
be "in tumble downish kind of a condition," but it
survived until 1864, when it made way for the Inns of
Court Hotel.</p>

<p>A group of inns which remained more recently were
Ridler's "Bell and Crown," the old "Bell," and the
"Black Bull," all on the north side of Holborn. Of these,
the most picturesque was the "Bell," about which I have
been able to ascertain some curious facts. The earliest
notice of it that has come to light was on the 14th of
March, 1538, when William Barde sold a messuage with
garden called the "Bell," in the parish of St. Andrew,
Holborn, to Richard Hunt, citizen and girdler. The latter,
who died in 1569, gave thirty sacks of charcoal yearly
for ever, as a charge on the property, to be distributed
to thirty poor persons of the parish. After various
changes of ownership, in 1679-80 it passed into the hands
of Ralph Gregge, and his grandson sold it in 1722 to
Christ's Hospital. In the deed of sale three houses are
mentioned and described as "formerly one great mansion-house
or inn known as the Bell or Blue Bell." About
two years before, the front of the premises facing Holborn
had been rebuilt, when the sculptured arms of Gregge
were let into the wall in front; these arms are now at
the Guildhall Museum. The "Bell" became a coaching
house of considerable reputation, that part of the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
being about the year 1836 in the hands of Messrs.
B. W. and H. Horne, who, as coach proprietors, were
second only to William Chaplin. For many years, until
finally closed in September, 1897, the house was managed
by the Bunyer family. It was the last galleried inn on the
Middlesex side of the water, the galleries being perhaps
as old as the reign of Charles II. A still older portion
was a cellar built of stone immediately to the left of
the entrance, which might almost have been mediæval.
The rest of the building seems to have dated from the
early part of the eighteenth century. There is a
sympathetic reference to the old "Bell" by William Black
in his <i>Strange Adventures of a Phæton</i>. Another noteworthy
"Bell" Inn was that in Carter Lane, whence
Richard Quyney wrote in 1598 to his "loveing good ffrend
and contreyman Mr. Willm Shackespere," the only letter
addressed to our greatest poet which is known to exist.
There is still a Bell yard connecting Carter Lane with
Knightrider Street. The first scene of the <i>Harlot's
Progress</i>, by Hogarth, is laid in front of an inn, with the
sign of the "Bell" in Wood Street. Above the door are
chequers.</p>

<p>A short distance west of the Holborn house was
the "Crown" Inn, latterly Ridler's "Bell and Crown,"
destroyed about 1899. It had been a coaching centre,
but years ago the yard was built over, and it flourished
to the end as a quiet family hotel. Next to the "Bell"
on the east side was the "Black Bull," the front of which,
with the carved sign of a bull in a violent state of
excitement, remained after the rest of the inn had disappeared,
outliving its neighbour for a brief period. It
was in existence for a couple of hundred years or more,
but future generations will probably only remember it
as the house where Mr. Lewson was taken ill, and placed
under the tender mercies of Betsy Prig and Mrs. Gamp;
whence also, when convalescent, he was assisted into
a coach, Mould the undertaker eyeing him with regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
as he felt himself baulked of a piece of legitimate
business.</p>

<p>A few short years ago if, on leaving this group of
Holborn inns, we had turned down Fetter Lane in the
direction of Fleet Street, after passing two or three gabled
buildings still standing on the right hand side, we should
have come to another old hostelry called the "White
Horse," of which there is a well-known coloured print
from a drawing made by Pollard in 1814, with a coach
in front called the Cambridge Telegraph. It gradually
fell into decay, became partly a "pub" and partly a
common lodging-house, and with its roomy stabling at
the back was swept away in 1897-98. Most of the
structure was of the eighteenth century, but there were
remains of an earlier wooden building. Its northern
boundary touched the precinct of Barnard's Inn, an
inn of chancery, now disestablished and adapted for the
purposes of the Mercers' School.</p>

<p>Continuing our course southward, a short walk would
formerly have taken us to the "Bolt-in-Tun," I think
the only coaching establishment in Fleet Street, which
possessed so many taverns and coffee-houses. The inn
was of ancient origin, the White Friars having had a
grant of the "Hospitium vocatum Le Bolt en ton"
as early as the year 1443. The sign is the well-known
rebus on the name of Bolton, the bird-bolt through
a tun or barrel, which was the device of a prior of
St. Bartholomew's, Smithfield, and may still be seen in
the church there, and at Canonbury, where the priors had
a country house. The <i>City Press</i> for September 12th,
1882, announces the then impending destruction of the
"Bolt-in-Tun," and in the following year we are told
that although a remnant of it in Fleet Street exists as
a booking office for parcels, by far the larger portion,
represented chiefly by the Sussex Hotel, Bouverie Street,
which bore on it the date 1692, has just disappeared.</p>

<p>Further east, on Ludgate Hill, La Belle Sauvage Yard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
where Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co. carry on their important
business, marks the site of an historic house, and
perpetuates an error of nomenclature. Its original title, as
proved by a document of the year 1452, was "Savage's"
Inn, otherwise called the "Bell on the Hoop," but in the
seventeenth century a trade token was issued from here,
having on it an Indian woman holding a bow and arrow,
and in 1676 "Bell Sauvage" Inn, on Ludgate Hill, consisting
of about forty rooms, with good cellarage and
stabling for about one hundred horses, was to be let.
The mistake is repeated in <i>The Spectator</i>, No. 28, where
we are told of a beautiful girl who was found in the
wilderness, and whose fame was perpetuated in a French
romance. As we learn from Howe, in his continuation
of <i>Stow's Annals</i>, on a seat outside this inn Sir Thomas
Wyat rested, after failing in an attempt to enter the city
during his ill-advised rebellion in the reign of Mary
Tudor. From Lambarde we gather that this was one
of the houses where plays were performed before the
time of Shakespeare. Writing in 1576, he says, "Those
who go to Paris Garden, the Bell Savage, or the Theatre
to behold bear-baiting, interludes, or fence play, must
not account of any pleasant spectacle unless first they
pay one pennie at the gate, another at the entrie of the
scaffold, and a third for quiet standing." Here, as at
the "Cross Keys," Gracechurch Street, Bankes exhibited
his horse, and here, in 1683, "a very strange beast called
a Rhynoceros&mdash;the first that ever was in England," could
be seen daily. Stow affirms the inn to have been given
to the Cutlers' Company by Isabella Savage; but, in
fact, the donor was John Craythorne, who conveyed the
reversion of it to them in 1568. The sculptured elephant
and castle representing their crest is still on a wall in
La Belle Sauvage Yard. The inn, which has left its
mark in the annals of coaching, was taken down in 1873.</p>

<p>A thoroughfare, formerly containing several fine
mansions and various inns for travellers, was Aldersgate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
Street, the continuation of St. Martin's-le-Grand. There
are allusions in print to the "Bell," the "George" (previously
the "White Hart"), and to the "Cock" Inn,
where, after years of wandering, Fynes Moryson arrived
one Sunday morning in 1595; but these all passed away
long ago. The last to linger in the neighbourhood was the
"Bull and Mouth," St Martin's-le-Grand, finally called the
"Queen's" Hotel, absorbed by the General Post Office
in 1886. The name is generally supposed to be a
corruption of Boulogne Mouth, the entrance to Boulogne
Harbour, that town having been taken by Henry VIII.
George Steevens, the Shakespearean commentator, seems
to have suggested this, and his idea has been generally
accepted; but it is more likely that our inn was identical
with the house called in 1657 "the Mouth near
Aldersgate in London, then the usual meeting-place
for Quakers," to which the Body of John Lilburne was
conveyed in August of that year. We learn from
Ellwood's <i>Autobiography</i> that five years afterwards he
was arrested at the "Bull and Mouth," Aldersgate. The
house was at its zenith as a coaching centre in the early
years of the nineteenth century, when Edward Sherman
had become landlord. He rebuilt the old galleried house
in 1830. When coaching for business purposes ceased to
be, the gateway from St. Martin's-le-Grand was partially
blocked up and converted into the main entrance,
the inn continuing under its changed name for many
years. The sculptured signs were not removed until the
destruction of the building. One, which was over the
main entrance, is a statuette of a Bull within a gigantic
open Mouth; below are bunches of grapes; above, a
bust of Edward VI. and the arms of Christ's Hospital,
to which institution the ground belonged. Beneath is
a tablet inscribed with the following doggerel rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Milo the Cretonian an ox slew with his fist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate it up at one meal, ye Gods what a glorious twist."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another version of the sign, the Mouth appearing below
the Bull, was over what had been a back entrance to
the yard in Angel Street. These signs are now both in
the Guildhall Museum. I had almost overlooked one
house, the "Castle and Falcon," Aldersgate, closed within
the last few months, and now destroyed. The structure
was uninteresting, but it stood on an old site&mdash;that of
John Day's printing-house in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. At the present inn on April 12th, 1799, was
founded the Church Missionary Society; here also its
centenary was celebrated.</p>

<p>Besides being plentiful in the main thoroughfares,
important inns, like the churches, were often crammed
away in narrow and inconvenient lanes. This was the
case with the "Oxford Arms" and the "Bell," both in
Warwick Lane. The former was approached by a
passage, being bounded on the west by the line of the
old city wall, or by a later wall a few feet to the
east of it, and touching Amen Corner on the south.
It was a fine example of its kind. As was said by a
writer in <i>The Athenæum</i> of May 20th, 1876, just before
it was destroyed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Despite the confusion, the dirt and the decay, he who stands in
the yard of this ancient inn may get an excellent idea of what it was
like in the days of its prosperity, when not only travellers in coach or
saddle rode into or out of the yard, but poor players and mountebanks
set up their stage for the entertainment of spectators, who hung over the
galleries or looked on from their rooms&mdash;a name by which the boxes of a
theatre were first known."</p></div>

<p>The house must have been rebuilt after the Great Fire,
which raged over this area. That it existed before is
proved by the following odd advertisement of March,
1672-73:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"These are to give notice that Edward Bartlet, Oxford Carrier, hath
removed his inn in London from the Swan at Holborn Bridge to the
Oxford Arms in Warwick Lane, where he did Inn before the Fire. His
coaches and waggons going forth on their usual days, Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays. He hath also a hearse and all things convenient
to carry a Corps to any part of England."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span></p></div>

<p>The "Bell" Inn, also galleried, was on the east side
of Warwick Lane. There Archbishop Leighton died in
1684. As Burnet tells us, he had often said that "if
he were to choose a place to die in it should be an Inn;
it looked like a pilgrim's going home, to whom this world
was all as an Inn, and who was weary of the noise and
confusion in it." Thus his desire was fulfilled. There
is a view of the old house in Chambers' <i>Book of Days</i>,
vol. i., p. 278. It was demolished in 1865, when the value
of the unclaimed parcels, some of which had been there
many years, is said to have been considerable. According
to one statement, the jewellery was worth £700 or £800.</p>

<p>The few remaining inns to which reference will be
made may best perhaps be taken in alphabetical order.
The old "Angel" Inn, at the end of Wych Street, Strand,
already existed in February, 1503, when a letter was
directed to Sir Richard Plumpton "at the Angell behind
St. Clement's Kirk." From this inn Bishop Hooper was
taken to Gloucester in 1554 to be burnt at the stake. A
trade token was issued there in 1657. Finally, the
business, largely dependent on coaches, faded away; the
building was rased to the ground in 1853, and the set of
offices called Danes Inn built on the site. These in their
turn have now succumbed. The "Axe" in Aldermanbury
was a famous carriers' inn. It is mentioned in drunken
Barnabee's <i>Journal</i>, and from there the first line of stage
waggons from London to Liverpool was established
about the middle of the seventeenth century. It took
many days to perform the journey.</p>

<p>In Laurence Lane, near the Guildhall, was a noteworthy
house called "Blossoms" Inn, which, according
to Stow, had "to sign St. Laurence the Deacon in a
border of blossoms of flowers." In 1522, when the
Emperor Charles V. came to visit Henry VIII. in London,
certain inns were set apart for the reception of his retinue,
among them "St. Laurence, otherwise called Bosoms Yn,
was to have ready XX beddes and a stable for LX<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
horses." In Ben Jonson's <i>Masque of Christmas</i>,
presented at Court in 1616, "Tom of Bosomes Inn,"
apparently a real person, is introduced as representing
Mis-rule. That the house was early frequented by
carriers is shown in the epistle dedicatory to <i>Have
at you at Saffron Walden</i>, 1596:&mdash;"Yet have I naturally
cherisht and hugt it in my bosome, even as a carrier at
Bosome's Inne doth a cheese under his arm." A satirical
tract about Bankes and his horse Marocco gives the
name of the authors as "John Dande the wiredrawer of
Hadley, and Harrie Hunt head ostler of Bosomes inn."
There is a view of this famous hostelry in the Crace
collection, date 1855; the yard is now a depôt for
railway goods.</p>

<p>In 1852 London suffered a sad loss architecturally by
the removal of the fine groined crypt of Gerard's Hall,
Basing Lane, which dated perhaps from the end of the
thirteenth century, and had formed part of the mansion
of a famous family of citizens, by name Gysors. In
Stow's time it was "a common hostrey for receipt of
travellers." He gives a long account of it, mixing fact
with fiction. The house and hall were destroyed in the
Great Fire, but the crypt escaped, and on it an inn
was built with, in front, a carved wooden effigy of that
mythical personage, Gerard the Giant, which is now in
the Guildhall Museum. On the removal of the crypt
the stones were numbered and presented to the Crystal
Palace Company, with a view to its erection in their
building or grounds. It is said, however, that after a
time the stones were used for mending roads.</p>

<p>A rather unimportant-looking inn was the "Nag's
Head," on the east side of Whitcomb Street, formerly
Hedge Lane, but it is worthy of mention for one or two
reasons. We learn from a manuscript note-book, which
was in the possession of the late Mr. F. Locker Lampson,
that Hogarth in his later days, when he set up a coach
and horses, kept them at the "Nag's Head." He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
then living on the east side of Leicester Square. According
to a pencil note on an old drawing, which belongs
to the writer, "this inn did the posting exclusively for
the Royal family from George I. to William IV." It
was latterly used as a livery stable, but retained its
picturesque galleries until, the lease having come to an
end, it was closed in 1890. The space remained vacant
for some years, and is now covered by the fine publishing
office of Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Two "Saracen's Head" inns have already been
described, and though one feels how imperfect this
account must of necessity be, and that some houses of
note are altogether omitted, I am tempted to mention a
third&mdash;the house with that sign in Friday Street. It
came into the hands of the Merchant Taylors' Company
as early as the year 1400, and after several rebuildings
was finally swept away in 1844. The adjoining house,
said by tradition to have been occupied by Sir Christopher
Wren, was destroyed at the same time.</p>

<p>It was in the early thirties of last century that coaching
reached its zenith, and perhaps the greatest coaching
centre in London was the "Swan with Two Necks," Lad
Lane. It was an old inn, mentioned by Machyn as early
as 1556. In 1637 carriers from Manchester and other
places used to lodge there, but it will be best
remembered as it appears in a well-known print during
the heyday of its prosperity, the courtyard crowded with
life and movement. The gateway was so narrow that
it required some horsemanship to drive a fast team out
of the said courtyard, and some care on the part of the
guard that his horn or bugle basket was not jammed
against the gate-post. The proprietor of this establishment
was Mr. William Chaplin who, originally a coachman,
became perhaps the greatest coach proprietor that
ever lived. About 1835 he occupied the yards of no
fewer than five famous and important inns in London,
to all of which allusion has been made&mdash;the "Spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
Eagle" and "Cross Keys" in Gracechurch Street, the
"Swan with Two Necks," the "White Horse," Fetter
Lane, and the "Angel" behind St. Clement's. He had
1,300 horses at work on various roads, and about that
time horsed fourteen out of the twenty-seven coaches
leaving London every night. When the railways came
he bowed to the inevitable, and, in partnership with Mr.
Horne, established the great carrying business, which still
flourishes on the site of the old "Swan with Two Necks."
In 1845 Lad Lane was absorbed by Gresham Street. The
origin of the sign has been often discussed, but it is
perhaps well to conclude this chapter by adding a few
words about it. The swans on the upper reaches of the
Thames are owned respectively by the Crown and the
Dyers and the Vintners' Company, and, according to
ancient custom, the representatives of these several owners
make an excursion each year up the river to mark the
cygnets. The visitors' mark used to consist of the
chevron or letter V and two nicks on the beak. The
word nicks has been corrupted into necks, and as the
Vintners were often tavern-keepers, the "Swan with Two
Necks" became a common sign.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_OLD_LONDON_COFFEE-HOUSES" id="THE_OLD_LONDON_COFFEE-HOUSES">THE OLD LONDON COFFEE-HOUSES</a></h2>

<p class='p3'><span class="smcap">By G. L. Apperson, I.S.O.</span></p>



<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-f.png" width="100" height="119" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">For something like a century and a half
the coffee-houses formed a distinctive feature
of London life. The first is said to have
been established by a man named Bowman,
servant to a Turkey merchant, who opened a
coffee-house in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill, in 1652.
The honour of being the second has been claimed
for the "Rainbow" in Fleet Street, by the Inner
Temple Gate, opposite Chancery Lane. Aubrey, speaking
of Sir Henry Blount, a beau in the time of
Charles II., says: "When coffee first came in, he was
a great upholder of it, and had ever since been a constant
frequenter of coffee-houses, especially Mr. Farre's, at the
'Rainbow,' by Inner Temple Gate." But according to <i>The
Daily Post</i> of May 15th, 1728, "Old Man's" Coffee-house,
at Charing Cross, "was the Second that was set
up in the Cities of London and Westminster." The
question of priority, however, is of no importance. It
is quite certain that in a surprisingly short space of
time coffee-houses became very numerous. A manuscript
of 1659, quoted in <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1852
(Part I., pp. 477-9), says that at that date there was</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"a Turkish drink to be sould almost in eury street, called Coffee, and
another kind of drink called Tee, and also a drink called Chocolate,
which was a very harty drink."</p></div>

<p>Tea made its way slowly; but coffee took the town by
storm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span></p>

<p>The coffee-houses, as resorts for men of different classes
and occupations, survived till the early years of the nineteenth
century; but their palmy days were over some
time before the end of the eighteenth century. They
were at the height of their fame and usefulness from the
Restoration till the earlier years of George III.'s reign.</p>

<p>From the description given in <i>The Spectator</i> and other
contemporary writings&mdash;such as "facetious" Tom Brown's
<i>Trip through London</i> of 1728, and the like&mdash;it is easy
to reconstruct in imagination the interior of one of these
resorts as they appeared in the time of Queen Anne.
Occasionally the coffee-room, as at the famous "Will's"
in Russell Street, Covent Garden, was on the first floor.
Tables were disposed about the sanded floor&mdash;the erection
of boxes did not come in until a later date&mdash;while on
the walls were numerous flaming advertisements of quack
medicines, pills and tinctures, salves and electuaries, which
were as abundant then as now, and of other wares which
might be bought at the bar. The bar was at the entrance
to the temple of coffee and gossip, and was presided over
by the predecessors of the modern barmaids&mdash;grumbled
at in <i>The Spectator</i> as "idols," who there received homage
from their admirers, and who paid more attention to
customers who flirted with them than to more sober-minded
visitors; and described by Tom Brown as "a
charming Phillis or two, who invite you by their amorous
glances into their smoaky territories."</p>

<p>At the bar messages were left and letters taken in
for regular customers. In the early days of Swift's
friendship with Addison, Stella was instructed to address
her letters to the former under cover to Addison at the
"St. James's" Coffee-house, in St. James's Street; but as
the friendship between the two men cooled the cover was
dispensed with, and the letters were addressed to Swift
himself at the coffee-house, where they were placed,
doubtless with many others, in the glass frame behind
the bar. Stella's handwriting was very like that of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
famous correspondent, and one day Harley, afterwards
Earl of Oxford, seeing one of Stella's letters in the
glass frame and thinking the writing was Swift's, asked
the latter, when he met him shortly afterwards, how long
he had learned the trick of writing to himself. Swift
says he could hardly persuade him that he was mistaken
in the writing.</p>

<p>The coffee-houses were the haunts of clubs and coteries
almost from the date of their first establishment. Steele,
in the familiar introduction to <i>The Tatler</i>, tells us how
accounts of gallantry, pleasure and entertainment were
to come from "White's" Chocolate-house; poetry from
"Will's" Coffee-house; learning from the "Grecian"; and
foreign and domestic news from the "St. James's."
Nearly fifty years later, Bonnell Thornton, in the first
number of <i>The Connoisseur</i>, January 31st, 1754, similarly
enumerates some of the leading houses. "White's" was
still the fashionable resort; "Garraway's" was for stock-jobbers;
"Batson's" for doctors; the "Bedford" for
"wits" and men of parts; the "Chapter" for book-sellers;
and "St. Paul's" for the clergy. Mackay, in his <i>Journey
through England</i>, published in 1724, says that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"about twelve the <i>beau-monde</i> assembles in several chocolate and coffee-houses,
the best of which are the Cocoa Tree and White's Chocolate-houses,
St. James's, the Smyrna, and the British Coffee-houses; and all
these so near one another that in less than an hour you see the company
of them all.... I must not forget to tell you that the parties have
their different places, where, however, a stranger is always well received;
but a Whig will no more go to the Cocoa Tree or Ozinda's than a Tory
will be seen at the coffee-house of St. James's. The Scots go generally to
the British, and a mixture of all sorts to the Smyrna. There are other
little coffee-houses much frequented in this neighbourhood&mdash;Young
Man's for officers, Old Man's for stock-jobbers, paymasters, and courtiers,
and Little Man's for sharpers."</p></div>

<p>It was only natural that people of similar occupations
or tastes should gravitate in their hours of leisure to
common social centres, and no one classification, such as
that just quoted, can exhaust the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span></p>

<p>The devotees of whist had their own houses. The
game began to be popular about 1730, and some of those
who first played scientific whist&mdash;possibly including Hoyle
himself&mdash;were accustomed to meet at the "Crown"
Coffee-house in Bedford Row. Other groups soon met
at other houses. A pirated edition of Hoyle's <i>Whist</i>,
printed at Dublin in 1743, contains an advertisement of
"A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist, as play'd at
Court, White's, and George's Chocolate-houses, at
Slaughter's, and the Crown Coffee-houses, etc., etc." At
"Rawthmell's" Coffee-house in Henrietta Street, Covent
Garden, the Society of Arts was founded in 1754. "Old
Slaughter's" in St. Martin's Lane was a great resort
in the second half of the eighteenth century of artists.
Here Roubillac the sculptor, Hogarth, Bourguignon or
Gravelot the book illustrator, Moser the keeper of the
St. Martin's Lane Academy, Luke Sullivan the engraver,
and many others of the fraternity were wont to foregather.
Near by was "Young Slaughter's," a meeting-place
for scientific and literary men.</p>

<p>R. L. Edgeworth, in his <i>Memoirs</i> (p. 118, Ed. 1844),
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I was introduced by Mr. Keir into a society of literary and scientific
men, who used formerly to meet once a week at Jack's Coffee-house
[<i>i.e., circa 1780</i>] in London, and afterwards at Young Slaughter's Coffee-house.
Without any formal name, this meeting continued for years to
be frequented by men of real science and of distinguished merit. John
Hunter was our chairman. Sir Joseph Banks, Solander, Sir A. Blagden,
Dr. George Fordyce, Milne, Maskelyne, Captain Cook, Sir G. Shuckburgh,
Lord Mulgrave, Smeaton and Ramsden, were among our members. Many
other gentlemen of talents belonged to this club, but I mention those
only with whom I was individually acquainted."</p></div>

<p>A favourite resort of men of letters during the middle
and later years of the eighteenth century was the
"Bedford" Coffee-house, under the Piazza, in Covent
Garden. This house, it may be said, inherited the
tradition from Button's, which that famous coffee-house
had taken over from Will's. To the "Bedford" came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
Fielding, Foote, Garrick, Churchill, Sheridan, Hogarth,
and many another man of note. Another haunt of literary
men, as well as of book-sellers, was the "Chapter" Coffee-house
in Paternoster Row. Chatterton wrote to his
mother in May, 1770: "I am quite familiar at the
'Chapter' Coffee-house, and know all the geniuses there."
Goldsmith was one of its frequenters. It was here that
he came to sup one night as the invited guest of
Churchill's friend, Charles Lloyd. The supper was
served and enjoyed, whereupon Lloyd, without a penny
in his pocket to pay for the meal he had ordered, coolly
walked off and left Goldsmith to discharge the reckoning.
It was at the same house that Foote, one day when a
distressed player passed his hat round the coffee-room
circle with an appeal for help, made the malicious
remark: "If Garrick hear of this he will certainly send
in his hat."</p>

<p>Close by was the "St. Paul's" Coffee-house, where,
according to Bonnell Thornton, "tattered crapes," or
poor parsons, were wont to ply "for an occasional burial
or sermon, with the same regularity as the happier
drudges who salute us with the cry of 'Coach, sir,' or
'Chair, your honour.'" The same writer relates how a
party of bucks, by a hoaxing proffer of a curacy, "drew
all the poor parsons to 'St. Paul's' Coffee-house, where
the bucks themselves sat in another box to smoke their
rusty wigs and brown cassocks."</p>

<p>Business men gathered at "Jonathan's" and "Garraway's,"
both in Exchange Alley, where the sale and
purchase of stocks and bonds and merchandise of every
kind formed the staple talk. The former house was a
centre of operations for both bubblers and bubbled in
the mania year of 1720. "Lloyd's" Coffee-house was for
very many years a famous auction mart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then to Lloyd's coffee-house he never fails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read the letters, and attend the sales,"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>says the author of <i>The Wealthy Shopkeeper</i>, published in
1700. Addison, in No. 46 of <i>The Spectator</i>, tells how he
was accustomed to make notes or "minutes" of anything
likely to be useful for future papers, and of how one day
he accidentally dropped one of these papers at "Lloyd's
Coffee-house, where the auctions are usually kept." It
was picked up and passed from hand to hand, to the
great amusement of all who saw it. Finally, the "boy
of the coffee-house," having in vain asked for the owner
of the paper, was made "to get up into the auction pulpit
and read it to the whole room." The "Jerusalem" Coffee-house,
in Exchange Alley, was for generations the resort
of merchants and traders interested in the East.</p>

<p>The doctors met at "Batson's" or "Child's." The
pseudonymous author of Don Manoel Gonzales' <i>Voyage
to Great Britain</i>, 1745, speaking of the London physicians,
says: "You find them at Batson's or Child's Coffee-house
usually in the morning, and they visit their patients in the
afternoon." The Jacobites had two well-known houses
of call&mdash;"Bromefield's" Coffee-house in Spring Gardens,
and, later, the "Smyrna" in Pall Mall. Mr. J. H.
MacMichael, in his valuable book on <i>Charing Cross</i>, 1906,
quotes an order "given at their Majesties' Board of Green
Cloth at Hampton Court" in 1689, to Sir Christopher
Wren, Surveyor of Their Majesties' Works, to have
"bricked or otherwise so closed up as you shall judge
most fit for the security of their Majesties' Palace of
Whitehall" a certain door which led out of Buckingham
Court into Spring Garden, because Bromefield's Coffee-house
in that court was resorted to by "a great and
numerous concourse of Papists and other persons disaffected
to the Government." Mr. MacMichael suggests
that probably "Bromefield's" was identical with the
coffee-house known as "Young Man's." "The Smyrna,"
in Pall Mall, was the Jacobite resort in Georgian days. It
was also a house of many literary associations. Thomson,
the poet, there received subscriptions for his <i>Seasons</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
Swift and Prior and Arbuthnot frequented it. In 1703
Lord Peterborough wrote to Arbuthnot from Spain:&mdash;"I
would faine save Italy and yett drink tea with you at
the Smirna this Winter." But it is impossible to catalogue
fully all the different coffee-house centres. The
"Grecian" in Devereux Court, Strand, was devoted to
learning; barristers frequented "Serle's," at the corner of
Serle and Portugal Streets, Lincoln's Inn Fields; the
Templars went to "Dick's," and later to the "Grecian";
and so the list might be prolonged.</p>

<p>In the earlier days of the coffee-houses the coterie
or club of regular frequenters foregathered by the fire,
or in some particular part of the general room, or in
an inner room. At "Will's" in Russell Street, Covent
Garden, where Mr. Pepys used to drop in to hear the
talk, Dryden, the centre of the literary circle which
there assembled, had his big arm-chair in winter by the
fireside, and in summer on the balcony. Around him
gathered many men of letters, including Addison,
Wycherley, Congreve, and the juvenile Pope, and all who
aspired to be known as "wits." On the outskirts of the
charmed circle hovered the more humble and modest
frequenters of the coffee-room, who were proud to obtain
the honour even of a pinch of snuff from the poet's box.
Across the road at "Button's," a trifle later, Addison
became the centre of a similar circle, though here the tone
was political quite as much as literary. Whig men of
letters discussed politics as well as books. Steele, Tickell,
Budgell, Rowe, and Ambrose Phillips were among the
leading figures in this coterie. Pope was of it for a time,
but withdrew after his quarrel with Addison.</p>

<p>Whig politicians met at the "St. James's"; and
Addison, in a <i>Spectator</i> of 1712, pictures the scene. A
rumour of the death of Louis XIV. had set the tongues
going of all the gossips and quidnuncs in town; and the
essayist relates how he made a tour of the town to hear
how the news was received, and to catch the drift of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
popular opinion on so momentous an event. In the course
of his peregrinations the silent gentleman visited the
"St. James's," where he found the whole outer room in
a buzz of politics. The quality of the talk improved as
he advanced from the door to the upper end of the room;
but the most thorough-going politicians were to be found
"in the inner room, with the steam of the coffee-pot," and
in this sanctum, says the humorist, "I heard the whole
Spanish monarchy disposed of, and all the line of
Bourbon provided for, in less than a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>In later days coffee-house clubs became more exclusive.
The members of a club or coterie were allotted a room of
their own, to which admission ceased to be free and
open, and thus was marked the beginning of the
transition from the coffee-house of the old style to the
club-house of the new. In <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> for
1841 (Part II., pp. 265-9) is printed a paper of proposals,
dated January 23rd, 1768, for enlarging the accommodation
for the club accustomed to meet at Tom's Coffee-house,
Great Russell Street, Covent Garden, by taking
into the coffee-room the first floor of the adjoining house.
Admission to this club was obtained by ballot.</p>

<p>Coffee-houses were frequented for various purposes
besides coffee, conversation, and business&mdash;professional
or otherwise. The refreshments supplied were by no
means confined to such innocuous beverages as tea and
coffee and chocolate. Wines and spirits were freely consumed&mdash;"laced"
coffee, or coffee dashed with brandy,
being decidedly popular. Swift relates how on the
occasion of his christening the child of Elliot, the proprietor
of the "St. James's," he sat at the coffee-house
among some "scurvy companions" over a bowl of punch
so late that when he came home he had no time to
write to Stella. The prolonged sittings and too copious
libations of the company at Button's Coffee-house gave
the feeble and delicate Pope many a headache; and
Addison, who was notoriously a hard drinker, did not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
we may feel sure, confine himself during those prolonged
sittings to coffee.</p>

<p>The coffee-houses were also public reading-rooms.
There could be read the newspapers and other periodical
publications of the day. When Sir Roger de Coverley
entered "Squire's," near Gray's Inn Gate, he "called for
a clean pipe, a paper of tobacco, a dish of coffee, a wax
candle, and <i>The Supplement</i>."</p>

<p>Mackay, in his <i>Journey through England</i>, already
quoted, says that "in all the Coffee-houses you have not
only the foreign prints, but several English ones with the
Foreign Occurrences, besides papers of morality and
party disputes." Swift, writing to Stella, November 18th,
1711, says, "Do you read the <i>Spectators</i>? I never do;
they never come in my way; I go to no coffee-houses";
and when <i>The Tatler</i> had disappeared, a little earlier, Gay
wrote that "the coffee-houses began to be sensible that
the Esquire's lucubrations alone had brought them more
customers than all their other newspapers put together."
Periodical publications were filed for reference; and at
all the better houses <i>The London Gazette</i>, and, during
the session, the Parliamentary Votes could be seen. At
least one house possessed a library. This was the
"Chapter," in Paternoster Row, already referred to as
a literary haunt. Dr. Thomas Campbell, the author of
a <i>Diary of a Visit to England in 1775</i>, which was published
at Sydney in 1854, says that he had heard that
the "Chapter" was remarkable for a large collection of
books and a reading society.</p>

<p>The coffee-houses served as writing-rooms as well
as reading-rooms. Many of Steele's numerous love-letters
to "dear Prue," the lady who became his wife,
the lovely Mary Scurlock, written both before and after
his marriage, are dated from the "St. James's," the
"Tennis Court," "Button's," or other coffee-house. But a
popular coffee-room could hardly have been an ideal place
for either reading or writing. A poet of 1690 says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The murmuring buzz which thro' the room was sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did bee-hives' noise exactly represent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a bee-hive, too, 'twas filled, and thick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All tasting of the Honey Politick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called 'News,' which they all greedily sucked in."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And many years later, Gilly Williams, in a letter to
George Selwyn, dated November 1st, 1764, says: "I write
this in a full coffee-house, and with such materials, that
you have good luck if you can read two lines of it."</p>

<p>A curious proof of the close and intimate way in
which the coffee-houses were linked with social life
is to be seen in the occasional references, both in
dramatic and prose literature, to some of the well-known
servants of the coffee-houses. Steele, in the first number
of <i>The Tatler</i>, refers familiarly to Humphrey Kidney, the
waiter and keeper of book debts at the "St. James's"&mdash;he
"has the ear of the greatest politicians that come hither"&mdash;and
when Kidney resigned, it was advertised that he
had been "succeeded by John Sowton, to whose place of
caterer of messages and first coffee-grinder William Bird is
promoted, and Samuel Bardock comes as shoe-cleaner in
the room of the said Bird." "Robin, the Porter who waits
at Will's Coffee-house," plays a prominent part in a little
romance narrated in No. 398 of <i>The Spectator</i>. He is
described as "the best man in the town for carrying a
billet; the fellow has a thin body, swift step, demure
looks, sufficient sense, and knows the town." A waiter
of the same name at Locket's, in Spring Gardens, is
alluded to in Congreve's <i>The Way of the World</i>, where
the fashionable Lady Wishfort, when she threatens to
marry a "drawer" (or waiter), says, "I'll send for Robin
from Locket's immediately."</p>

<p>The coffee-houses were employed as agencies for the
sale of many things other than their own refreshments.
Most of them sold the quack medicines that were staringly
advertised on their walls. Some sold specific proprietary
articles. A newspaper advertisement of 1711 says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
the water of Epsom Old Well was "pumped out almost
every night, that you may have the new mineral every
morning," and that "the water is sold at Sam's Coffee-house
in Ludgate Street, Hargrave's at the Temple Gate,
Holtford's at the lower end of Queen's Street near
Thames Street, and nowhere else in London." A
"Ticket of the seal of the Wells" was affixed, so that
purchasers "might not be cheated in their waters." The
"Royal" Coffee-house at Charing Cross, which flourished
in the time of Charles II., sold "Anderson's Pills"&mdash;a
compound of cloves, jalap, and oil of aniseed. At the
same house were to be had tickets for the various county
feasts, then popular, which were an anticipation of the
annual dinners of county associations so common nowadays.</p>

<p>Razor-strops of a certain make were to be bought in
1705 at John's Coffee-house, Exchange Alley. In 1742
it was advertised that "silver tickets" (season tickets)
for Ranelagh Gardens were to be had at any hour of
the day at Forrest's Coffee-house, near Charing Cross.
"All Sorts of the newest fashion'd Tye Perukes, made of
fresh string, Humane Hair, far exceeding any Country
Work," were advertised in 1725 as to be bought at
Brown's Coffee-house in Spring Gardens.</p>

<p>House agents, professional men, and other folk of more
questionable kind, were all wont to advertise that they
could be seen by clients at this or that coffee-house.
The famous and impudent Mrs. Mapp, "the bone-setter,"
drove into town daily from Epsom in her own carriage,
and was to be seen (and heard) at the "Grecian." Most
of the houses were willing to receive letters in answer to
advertisements, and from the nature of the latter must
often, it is pretty certain, have been assisting parties to
fraud and chicanery of various kind. At some houses,
besides those like Lloyd's specially devoted to auction
business, sales were held. A black boy was advertised to
be sold at Denis's Coffee-house in Finch Lane in 1708. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
the middle of the eighteenth century sales were often held
at the "Apollo" Coffee-house, just within Temple Bar,
and facing Temple Gate. Picture sales were usually held
at coffee-houses. The catalogue of one such sale, held
at the "Barbadoes" Coffee-house in February, 1689/90,
contains a glowing address on the art of painting by
Millington, the Auctioneer, written in the style made
famous later by George Robins. Says the eloquent
Millington:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This incomparable art at the same time informs the Judgment, pleases
the Fancy, recreates the Eye, and touches the Soul, entertains the Curious
with silent Instruction, by expressing our most noble Passions, and never
fails of rewarding its admirers with the greatest Pleasures, so Innocent and
Ravishing, that the severest Moralists, the Morosest <i>Stoicks</i> cannot be
offended therewith,"</p></div>

<p>and so on and so on.</p>

<p>Many of the early book sales, too, were held at coffee-houses.
The third book auction in England, that of the
library of the Rev. William Greenhill, was held on
February 18th, 1677/78, "in the House of Ferdinand
Stable, Coffee-Seller, at the Sign of the 'Turk's Head,'"
in Bread Street. When sales were held elsewhere,
catalogues could usually be had at some of the leading
coffee-houses.</p>

<p>Besides serving as reading, writing and sale rooms,
they seem sometimes to have been used as lecture rooms.
William Whiston, in his <i>Memoirs</i> written by himself
(1749), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Addison, with his friend Sir Richard Steele, brought me upon
my banishment from Cambridge, to have many astronomical lectures at
Mr. Button's coffee-house, near Covent Garden, to the agreeable entertainment
of a great number of persons, and the procuring me and my
family some comfortable support under my banishment."</p></div>

<p>Some of the houses, as an additional attraction to
visitors, offered exhibitions of collections of curiosities.
The most famous collection of this kind was that to be
seen for many years at Don Saltero's Coffee-house at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
Chelsea. Don Saltero, by the way, was simply plain
James Salter disguised. Some of his exhibits were
supplied by his former master, Sir Hans Sloane, and by
other scientific friends and patrons. But mixed with
things of genuine interest were to be seen all sorts of
rubbish. Steele made fun of the collection in <i>The Tatler</i>.
But people came to see the "piece of nun's skin tanned,"
"Job's tears, which grow on a tree, and of which anodyne
necklaces are made," a "waistcoat to prevent sweating,"
and the many other strange articles which were shown
side by side with the wooden shoe (of doubtful authenticity,
one would think) which was placed under Mr.
Speaker's chair in the time of James II., the King of
Morocco's tobacco pipe, Oliver Cromwell's sword, and the
like "historical" curiosities; and Mr. Salter had no reason
to be dissatisfied with the results of his ingenuity. The
most interesting association of this coffee-house, perhaps,
is Pennant's story of how it was frequented by Richard
Cromwell, the quondam Lord Protector, described in his
peaceful age as "a little and very neat old man, with a
most placid countenance, the effect of his innocent and
unambitious life."</p>

<p>Not far from Don Saltero's was the old Chelsea Bun-house,
which also contained a museum. The last relics
of this collection were sold in April, 1839, and included
a few pictures, plaster casts, a model of the bun-house,
another, in cut paper, of St. Mary Redcliff Church, and
other things of a still more trumpery character.</p>

<p>Richard Thoresby tells us that when he was in
London, in the summer of 1714, he met his "old friend
Dr. Sloane at the coffee-house of Mr. Miers, who hath
a handsome collection of curiosities in the room where
the virtuosi meet." As the name of the proprietor only
is given, it is not easy to identify this house, but possibly
it was the "Grecian" in Devereux Court, which was a
favourite resort of the learned. It was at the "Grecian,"
by the way, that Goldsmith, in the latter years of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
life, was often the life and soul of the Templars who
were wont to meet there. In their company he sometimes
amused himself with the flute, or with whist&mdash;"neither
of which he played very well." When he took
what he called a "Shoemaker's holiday," Goldsmith, after
his day's excursion, "concluded by supping at the
'Grecian' or 'Temple-Exchange' Coffee-house, or at
the 'Globe' in Fleet Street."</p>

<p>A word must be said as to the manners of the frequenters
of coffee-houses. The author of <i>A Trip
through London</i>, 1728, tells of fops who stare you out
of countenance, and describes one man as standing with
his back to the fire "in a great coffee-house near the
Temple," and there spouting poetry&mdash;a remarkable specimen,
indeed, of the bore; but on the whole the evidence
goes to show that bad manners were usually resented by
the rest of the company, and that good humour and
good manners were marked characteristics of coffee-house
life. There were exceptional incidents, of course. A
fatal duel once resulted from a heated argument at the
"Grecian" about a Greek accent. One day, soon after
the first appearance of <i>The Tatler</i>, two or three well-dressed
men walked into the coffee-room of the
"St. James's," and began in a loud, truculent manner to
abuse Steele as the author of that paper. One of them
at last swore that he would cut Steele's throat or teach
him better manners. Among the company present was
Lord Forbes, with two friends, officers of high rank in
the army. When the cut-throat had uttered his threat,
Lord Forbes said significantly, "In this country you will
find it easier to cut a purse than to cut a throat," and
with the aid of the military gentlemen the bullies were
ignominiously turned out of the house. Many years later,
in 1776, the "St. James's" was the scene of a singular
act of senseless violence. It is tersely described in
a letter from Lord Carlisle to George Selwyn. He
writes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Baron de Lingsivy ran a French officer through the body on
Thursday for laughing in the St. James's Coffee-house. I find he did
not pretend that he himself was laughed at, but at that moment he
chose that the world should be grave. The man won't die, and the baron
will not be hanged."</p></div>

<p>Incidents of this kind, however, were of rare occurrence.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to attempt to exhaust the subject
of the Old London Coffee-houses in one brief chapter.
For a hundred years they focussed the life of the town.
Within their hospitable walls men of all classes and
occupations, independently, or in clubs and coteries, met
not only for refreshment, but for social intercourse&mdash;to
read and hear the news, to discuss the topics of the day,
to entertain and be entertained. This was the chief end
they served. Incidentally, as we have seen, they served
a number of other subsidiary and more of less useful
purposes. They died slowly. Gradually the better-class
houses became more exclusive, and were merged in clubs
of the modern kind. The inferior houses were driven
from public favour by the taverns and public-houses, or,
degenerating from their former condition, lingered on as
coffee-houses still, but of the lower type, which is not
yet quite extinct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_LEARNED_SOCIETIES_OF" id="THE_LEARNED_SOCIETIES_OF">THE LEARNED SOCIETIES OF
LONDON</a></h2>

<p class='p3'><span class="smcap">By Sir Edward Brabrook, C.B., F.S.A.</span></p>



<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.png" width="56" height="124" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In a sense some of the City Guilds are entitled to be
called "learned societies"&mdash;as the Apothecaries, the
Parish Clerks, the Stationers, and the Surgeons&mdash;but
they are dealt with under their proper head. By
the learned societies of London, we mean here those
voluntary bodies existing with or without royal patronage,
but relying wholly for support on the contributions of
their members, which have taken upon themselves the
promotion of knowledge in one or more of its branches.
The earliest which we have been able to trace is that
Society of Antiquaries which was founded in 1572, the
fourteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, at the house of Sir
Robert Cotton, under the presidency of Archbishop Parker.
It counted among its members Lancelot Andrewes, Bishop
of Winchester, William Camden, Sir William Dethicke,
Garter, William Lambarde, James Ley, Earl of Marlborough,
John Stow, Mr. Justice Whitelock, and other
antiquaries of distinction. It is said that James I. became
alarmed for the arcana of his Government and, as some
thought, for the established Church, and accordingly put
an end to the existence of the society in 1604.</p>

<p>His grandson, Charles II., founded the Royal Society
of London for improving natural knowledge in the year
1660, and thus gave effect to a project which had been in
the minds of many learned men for some time, is
expounded by Bacon in his scheme of Solomon's house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
and is perhaps best embodied in a letter which was
addressed by John Evelyn to the Hon. Robert Boyle on
September 1, 1659. The first meeting recorded in the
journals of the society was held on November 28, 1660,
and Evelyn was elected a member on December 26 of
that year. Sir R. Moray was the first president. Graunt
aptly called the society "The King's Privy Council for
Philosophy." Statutes were duly framed by the society,
and received the King's approval in January, 1662-3.
For many years it held its meetings at Gresham College,
with an interval of about four years (1669-1673), when it
occupied Chelsea College. Its charters (dated 1662,
1663, and 1669) gave it many privileges, among others that
of using a mace, and it was formerly said that the one used
by the society was the identical mace or "bauble" of
the Long Parliament, but that is an error. The society
began in 1663 the excellent practice, which has continued
to the present day, of celebrating the anniversary by
dining together on St. Andrew's Day (November 30). It
began on February 21, 1665-6, the formation of its
museum, a catalogue of which was published in 1681.
Many of its meetings were devoted to practical experiment;
thus, on November 14, 1666, the operation of
the transfusion of blood from one dog to another was
performed in the presence of the members. In 1671
Isaac Newton sent his reflecting telescope to the society,
and on January 11, 1671-2, he was elected a fellow. On
April 28, 1686, the manuscript of his <i>Principia</i> was
presented to the society, and it was published by the
society in the following year. Many great men have
been presidents of the society. Among them may
be mentioned Sir Christopher Wren, elected president
January 12, 1680-1; Samuel Pepys, 1684; Lord Somers,
Chancellor of England, 1698; Isaac Newton, 1703; Sir
Hans Sloane, on the death of Newton, 1726-7; Martin
Folkes, who was also a well-remembered President of the
Society of Antiquaries, 1741; the Earl of Macclesfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
1753; succeeded on his death by the Earl of Morton, 1764;
James West, 1768; James Barrow, and shortly afterwards,
Sir John Pringle, 1772; Sir Joseph Banks, 1777;
Wollaston, 1820; Davies Gilbert, 1826. In 1830, a contested
election took place between the Duke of Sussex
and Herschel the astronomer, when His Royal Highness
was elected by 119 votes to 111.</p>

<p>The Government have frequently availed themselves
of the existence of the Royal Society to
entrust it with important public duties. On December 12,
1710, the fellows of the society were appointed visitors
of the Royal Observatory. On February 7, 1712/3,
the King requested the society to supply enquiries
for his ambassadors. In 1742, and afterwards, it
assisted in the determination of the standards. In 1780
its public services were recognised by the grant of apartments
in Somerset House. In 1784 it undertook a
geodetical survey. Recently it has been entrusted by
Parliament with a sum of £4,000 a year, which it allots
towards encouraging scientific research. It has promoted
many public movements, such as Arctic expeditions,
magnetic observations, and the like. Originally its
members were drawn from two classes&mdash;the working-men
of science and the patrons of science; and the idea is
even now maintained by certain privileges in respect of
election given to privy councillors and peers; but the
recent tendency has been to restrict its fellowship to
persons eminent in physical science. The Royal Society
Club was founded in 1743, and still flourishes.</p>

<p>After the summary proceedings of James I., in 1604,
the antiquaries seem to have allowed the whole of the
seventeenth century to pass without any further attempt
at organisation, though we learn from Mr. Ashmole that
on July 2, 1659, an antiquaries' feast was held, and many
renowned antiquaries, such as Dugdale, Spelman, Selden,
and Anthony à Wood flourished at that time. On
November 5, 1707, three antiquaries met at the "Bear"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
Tavern in the Strand, and agreed to hold a weekly
meeting at the same place on Fridays at 6 o'clock, "and
sit till ten at farthest." Other antiquaries joined them,
and they removed next year to the "Young Devil"
Tavern in Fleet Street, where Le Neve became their
president.</p>

<p>In 1717 they resolved to form themselves into a

Its minutes have been regularly kept since January 1,
1718. The first volume bears the motto:</p>

the "antient monuments" the society was to study, as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Old Citys, Stations, Camps, public Buildings, Roads, Temples,
Abbys, Churches, Statues, Tombs, Busts, Inscriptions, Castles, Ruins,
Altars, Ornaments, Utensils, Habits, Seals, Armour, Pourtraits, Medals,
Urns, Pavements, Mapps, Charts, Manuscripts, Genealogy, Historys,
Observations, Emendations of Books, already published, and whatever
may properly belong to the History of Bryttish Antiquitys."</p></div>

<p>The earlier publications of the society consisted of a
series of fine prints engraved by George Vertue. In 1747
it began the issue of <i>Vetusta Monumenta</i>, and in 1770
the first edition of the first volume of <i>Archæologia, or
Miscellaneous Tracts relating to Antiquity</i>, appeared.
The Society's resources were modest. In the year 1736 its
income was only £61, but its expenditure was not more
than £11, and its accumulated funds amounted to £134.
In 1752 it obtained from George II., who declared himself
to be the founder and patron of the society, a Royal
Charter of Incorporation, reciting that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"the study of Antiquity and the History of former times, has ever been
esteemed highly commendable and usefull, not only to improve the minds
of men, but also to incite them to virtuous and noble actions, and such
as may hereafter render them famous and worthy examples to late
posterity."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span></p></div>

<p>The qualifications of a fellow are thus defined in the
charter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"By how much any persons shall be more excelling in the knowledge
of the Antiquities and History of this and other nations; by how much
the more they are desirous to promote the Honour, Business, and Emoluments
of this Society; and by how much the more eminent they shall be
for Piety, Virtue, Integrity, and Loyalty: by so much the more fit and
worthy shall such person be judged of being elected and admitted into
the said Society."</p></div>

<p>Like the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries
was to have and employ a sergeant-at-mace, and apartments
were allotted to it in Somerset House. From this
close neighbourhood grew an intimate association between
the two societies. Many persons belonged to both, and
although the paths of the two societies have since
diverged, that is still so in the case of about twenty
fellows. A practice grew up of attending each other's
meetings. For more than forty years that agreeable
form of interchange has ceased, and the societies contemplate
each other from opposite corners of the quadrangle
of Burlington House. The Fellows of the Society of
Antiquaries dined together for many years on St. George's
Day, April 23, the day prescribed for their anniversary
by the charter; but after a while the custom fell into
disuse, and it has only been revived of late years.</p>

<p>In 1753 the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures, and Commerce, now called the Royal
Society of Arts, was established. It held its first public
meeting in March, 1754. It was incorporated by Royal
Charter in 1847, and has for its objects:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"the encouragement of the arts, manufactures, and commerce of the
country, by bestowing rewards for such productions, inventions, or
improvements as tend to the employment of the poor, to the increase of
trade, and to the riches and honour of the kingdom; and for meritorious
works in the various departments of the fine arts; for discoveries, inventions
and improvements in agriculture, chemistry, mechanics, manufactures,
and other useful arts; for the application of such natural and
artificial products, whether of home, colonial, or foreign growth and
manufacture, as may appear likely to afford fresh objects of industry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
to increase the trade of the realm by extending the sphere of British
commerce; and generally to assist in the advancement, development, and
practical application of every department of science in connection with
the arts, manufactures, and commerce of this country."</p></div>

<p>Between 1754 and 1783 it distributed £28,434 by way
of premiums for inventions. For more than a century
and a half the society has devoted itself with unabated
zeal to the promotion of its objects&mdash;by meetings,
examinations, exhibitions, and in many other ways.</p>

<p>On January 13, 1800, the Royal Institution was founded.
In the words of one of its most distinguished professors,
it has been a fertile source of the popularity of science.
By means of its lectures, its laboratories, its libraries, and
its rewards for research, it greatly stimulated public
interest in scientific pursuits when there were few other
bodies in existence capable of doing so. It continues to
perform the same useful function, notwithstanding the
great increase in the number of specialist societies since
it was established. A feature of its lectures is the annual
course "adapted to a juvenile auditory." It has appointed
as its professors some of the most illustrious scientific
men, such as Sir Humphry Davy (up to 1812), Brande
(1813 to 1852, and afterwards as honorary professor),
Faraday (1852), and Tyndall (1853). The late Prince
Consort (Albert the Good) took great interest in its work,
and frequently presided at its weekly meetings. It has
a Board of Managers, and also a Committee of Visitors,
annually elected, and the visitors make an annual report
on the state of the institution. After some early pecuniary
difficulties it entered on a career of steady prosperity.</p>

<p>In 1807 the Geological Society was founded. The
science of geology was very much opposed to popular
notions derived from a literal interpretation of the Hebrew
cosmogony, and was accordingly unpopular among those
who held those notions; but the society steadily pursued
its object, and can now look back upon the hundred years
of its existence with pride and satisfaction. In one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
presidential addresses Sir Charles Lyell quoted the
observation of Hutton, that "We can see neither the
beginning nor the end of that vast series of phenomena
which it is our business as geologists to investigate."
Leonard Horner, another distinguished president, claimed
that the society had been a "powerful instrument for the
advancement of geological science, a centre of good
fellowship, and a band of independent scientific men, who
steadily and fearlessly promote the cause of truth." The
society grants an annual medal, founded in memory of
Wollaston, which has been frequently awarded to foreign
geologists of distinction; and it also administers a fund
bequeathed by him to promote useful researches in
geology.</p>

<p>In November, 1820, Dr. Burgess, the Bishop of St.
David's, obtained an audience of King George IV., and
laid before him a plan for the establishment of a Royal
Society of Literature. The King took so warm an interest
in the project as to assign out of his privy purse an annual
sum of 1,100 guineas, out of which pensions of 100 guineas
each were awarded to ten royal associates of the society,
and two medals annually granted to distinguished literary
men. Among the royal associates were Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, T. R. Malthus, William Roscoe, and Sharon
Turner. Among the medallists were Dugald Stewart,
Walter Scott, Robert Southey, Washington Irving, and
Henry Hallam. Upon September 15, 1825, the society
received its Charter of Incorporation, in which its object
is defined to be:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"the advancement of literature by the publication of inedited remains
of ancient literature, and of such works as may be of great intrinsic
value, but not of that popular character which usually claims the attention
of publishers; by the promotion of discoveries in literature; by endeavouring
to fix the standard, as far as is practicable, and to preserve the purity
of the English language; by the critical improvement of English
lexicography; by the reading at public meetings of interesting papers
on history, philosophy, poetry, philology, and the arts, and the publication
of such of those papers as shall be approved of; by the assigning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
honorary rewards to works of great literary merit, and to important discoveries
in literature; and by establishing a correspondence with learned
men in foreign countries for the purpose of literary enquiry and
information."</p></div>

<p>The first method, the publication of inedited and other
works, has been greatly promoted by a bequest to the
society of £1,692 from the Rev. Dr. Richards. Out of the
income of this fund the <i>Orations of Hyperides</i>, edited
by the Rev. Churchill Babington; the <i>Discourses of
Philoxenus</i>, by Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge; the <i>Chronicle
of Adam of Usk</i>, by Sir E. Maunde Thompson;
Coleridge's <i>Christabel</i>, by E. H. Coleridge; and other
valuable works have been provided. The <i>Transactions</i>
of the society also contain many important papers. On
the death of George IV. the annual gift of 100 guineas to
each of the ten royal associates was withdrawn. The
society now acknowledges literary merit by the award
of the diploma of Honorary Fellow. In this capacity
many distinguished authors, both in this country and
abroad, have been and are associated with the society.</p>

<p>In its early years the society was hotly attacked by
Macaulay, who held that its claim to be an appreciator of
excellence in literature involved a claim to condemn
literature of which it disapproved, and was equivalent to
the establishment of a literary star-chamber. He
illustrated this by a rather feeble apologue, and nothing
in the subsequent history of the society has shown that
his apprehensions had any foundation. It has been very
modest in the exercise of the functions conferred upon
it by its charter, which included the foundation of a
college and the appointment of professors. At one time
it did appoint a professor of English archæology and
history, and it called upon every royal associate on his
admission to select some branch of literature on which
it should be his duty, once a year at least, to communicate
some disquisition or essay. The subject chosen by
Coleridge was a characteristic one:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The relations of opposition and conjunction, in which the poetry
(the Homeric and tragic), the religion, and the mysteries of ancient
Greece stood each to the other; with the differences between the sacerdotal
and popular religion; and the influences of theology and scholastic logic
on the language and literature of Christendom from the 11th century."</p></div>

<p>In pursuance of this undertaking he communicated a
disquisition on the "Prometheus" of Æschylus.</p>

<p>In 1827 the Royal Asiatic Society was founded. As
its title implies, it devotes itself to the study of the
languages, the literature, the history, and the traditions
of the peoples of Asia, especially of those inhabiting
our Indian dependency. It has enrolled in its ranks
many, if not all, the great Indian administrators and
the most distinguished Asiatic scholars. Daughter
societies have been established in the three Presidencies,
and have contributed to the collection of materials for its
work. Its transactions are of acknowledged value and
authority. In its rooms at Albemarle Street a library
and museum have been collected. Its latest publication
is a collection of Baluchi poems by Mr. Longworth
Dames, which has also been issued to the members of
the Folk-lore Society.</p>

<p>On September 26, 1831, the British Association for the
Advancement of Science held its first meeting at York.
It originated in a letter addressed by Sir David Brewster
to Professor Phillips, as secretary to the York Philosophical
Society. The statement of its objects appended
to its rules, as drawn up by the Rev. William Vernon
Harcourt, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Association contemplates no interference with the ground
occupied by other institutions. Its objects are:&mdash;To give a stronger
impulse and a more systematic direction to scientific inquiry&mdash;to promote
the intercourse of those, who cultivate science in different parts of the
British Empire, with one another and with foreign philosophers&mdash;to
obtain a more general attention to the objects of science, and a removal
of any disadvantages of a public kind which impede its progress."</p></div>

<p>The association was well described by the late Mr.
Spottiswoode as "general in its comprehensiveness; special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
in its sectional arrangement." The general business of
its meetings consists (1) in receiving and discussing communications
upon scientific subjects at the various sections
into which it is divided; (2) in distributing, under the
advice of a Committee of Recommendations, the funds
arising from the subscriptions of members and associates;
and (3) in electing a council upon whom devolves the
conduct of affairs until the next meeting. Although the
meetings are held in all parts of the United Kingdom,
and have been held in Canada and South Africa, the
British Association may be correctly described as a
London learned society, as its headquarters are in
London, where the council meets and directs its continuous
activities. One principal feature of its work, that of the
Research Committees, which, either with or without a
grant of money, pursue special enquiries with the view
of reporting to the next annual meeting, continues
throughout the year. The original designation of what
are now the sections was "Committees of Sciences,"
and these were&mdash;(1) mathematics and general physics,
(2) chemistry and mineralogy, (3) geology and
geography, (4) zoology and botany, (5) anatomy and
physiology, (6) statistics. The sectional arrangement was
begun in 1835, and the sections are now constituted
as follows&mdash;(<i>a</i>) mathematical and physical science,
(<i>b</i>) chemistry, (<i>c</i>) geology, (<i>d</i>) zoology, (<i>e</i>) geography,
(<i>f</i>) economic science and statistics, (<i>g</i>) engineering,
(<i>h</i>) anthropology, (<i>i</i>) physiology, (<i>k</i>) botany, (<i>l</i>) educational
science. At each annual meeting, which lasts a week, the
president of the next meeting is chosen, but the previous
president remains in office until the first day (Wednesday)
of that meeting, when he introduces his successor, who
delivers an address. Many memorable addresses have
been delivered by the distinguished men who have held
that office. Each section has also a president, chosen for
the year, and he delivers an address at the opening of
the proceedings of his section. These addresses usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
relate to the progress during the year, or during recent
years, of the science dealt with by the section, or to some
interesting matter developed by the personal researches
of the president himself. Men of eminence in the various
sciences are generally selected for and willingly accept the
office of Sectional President. The meetings of the British
Association have been called a "Parliament of Science,"
and its influence in promoting scientific movements and
rendering science popular has been very great.</p>

<p>In 1833 the Royal Geographical Society was founded.
It may fairly be called the most popular of all the
special societies, having about 4,000 members. It is
also one of the most wealthy, having an income of about
£10,000 a year. It has accumulated a fine series of
maps, and a large library of geographical literature.
Its quarterly journal is a store-house of the most recent
information relating to geographical exploration. By
medals and other rewards to explorers, by prizes awarded
in schools and training colleges, by the loan of instruments
to travellers, by the preparation of codes of
instruction for their use, and in many other ways, it applies
its resources to the extension of geographical knowledge.
It has taken an active part in the promotion of Arctic
and Antarctic exploration. As geographical researches
are matters of great public interest, its meetings are
sometimes important social functions, as on a recent
occasion, when a foreign prince was the lecturer, and our
King attended and spoke.</p>

<p>On March 15, 1834, the Statistical Society (now
Royal Statistical) was founded. It was one of the first
fruits of the activity of the British Association, which
established a Statistical Committee at the Cambridge
meeting in 1833, with Babbage as president. Their
report recommended the formation of a society for the
careful collection, arrangement, discussion, and publication
of facts bearing on or illustrating the complex
relations of modern society in its social, economical, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
political aspects, especially facts which can be stated
numerically and arranged in tables. The first president
was the Marquis of Lansdowne, and among his successors
have been many statesmen, such as Lord John Russell,
Mr. Gladstone, and Lord Goschen; authorities on finance,
as Lord Overstone, Mr. Newmarch, and Lord Avebury;
and eminent writers on statistics, as Dr. Farr, Sir Robert
Giffen, and the Right Hon. Charles Booth. As becomes
the orderly mind of a statistician, the society has been
very regular in its publications, having for seventy
years issued a yearly volume in quarterly parts, which
form a veritable mine of statistical information.</p>

<p>The society presents a Guy medal (in memory of
Dr. W. A. Guy) to the authors of valuable papers or to
others who have promoted its work, and a Howard
medal (in memory of the great philanthropist) to the
author of the best essay on a prescribed subject, generally
having relation to the public health. It has accumulated
a fine library of about 40,000 volumes of a special
character, containing the statistical publications of all
civilised countries. It has conducted some special
enquiries&mdash;as into medical charities, the production and
consumption of meat and milk, and the farm school
system of the Continent&mdash;upon which it has published
reports.</p>

<p>Among recent developments of statistical method in
which the society has taken part may be mentioned the
use of index-numbers for affording a standard of comparison
between statistics of different years, and a means
of correction of errors that would otherwise arise; and
the increasing use of the higher mathematical analysis
in determining the probabilities of error and defining the
curves of frequency in statistical observations. Professor
Edgeworth, Messrs. Bowley, Yule, Hooker, and others,
have made contributions to the <i>Journal</i> of the society
on these matters.</p>

<p>In 1844 an Ethnological Society was established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
under the presidency of Sir Charles Malcolm. Dr.
Richard King, the founder, became its secretary. In
1846 Dr. J. C. Prichard became president, and he and
Dr. King fulfilled respectively the same functions in an
ethnological sub-section of the section of zoology of the
British Association, which then met for the first time.
In Prichard's first anniversary address to the society, he
defines ethnology as "the history of human races or of
the various tribes of men who constitute the population
of the world. It comprehends all that can be learned
as to their origin and relations to each other." Prichard
died in 1848, and Sir C. Malcolm resumed the presidency,
which he held until his death on November 12, 1851.
In that year ethnology was transferred from the zoological
to the geographical section of the British Association.
Sir B. C. Brodie became the next president of the society.
He retired in 1854, and was succeeded by Sir James
Clark. The fourth and last volume of the first series
of the society's <i>Journal</i> was published in 1856, and a
series of <i>Transactions</i> begun in 1861. At that time
Mr. John Crawfurd was president of the society, and he
retained the office until his death in 1868, when he was
succeeded by Professor Huxley.</p>

<p>In 1862 Dr. James Hunt, the Honorary Foreign
Secretary of the Ethnological Society, withdrew from it,
and founded the Anthropological Society of London,
which held its first meeting on February 24, 1863, under
his presidency. In his inaugural address, he defined
anthropology as the science of the whole nature of man,
and ethnology as the history or science of nations or
races. The new society was active and aggressive. It
published translations of works of such writers as
Broca, Pouchet, Vogt, and Waitz, and of the famous
treatise of Blumenbach. Some of the papers read before
it attracted much attention, and were thought to have a
political bias. Many men whose names were well known
in the scientific world adhered to the Ethnological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
Society, and that society, under Mr. Crawfurd, entered
upon a more active career. The rivalry between the
two societies was prosecuted with great vigour until
January, 1871, when Professor Huxley effected an
amalgamation between them.</p>

<p>The title of the combined societies was agreed upon
as the "Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and
Ireland," to which, in 1907, has been added by the King's
command the prefix "Royal." In 1871 the department
of ethnology in the section of biology in the British
Association became the department of anthropology,
and in 1884 anthropology became a section of itself.
This was the final recognition by the Parliament of
Science that Hunt had fought for twenty years before.
In the interval, the claim of anthropology to this
recognition had been established by many great works,
such as Huxley's <i>Man's Place in Nature</i>, Darwin's
<i>Descent of Man</i>, Tylor's <i>Early History of Mankind</i>, and
Lubbock's <i>Prehistoric Times</i>. Besides its annual
<i>Journal</i>, the Anthropological Institute publishes a
monthly periodical entitled <i>Man</i>, and it has issued
several separate monographs. In 1878 the branch of
anthropology, aptly termed "Folk-lore" by the late
Mr. W. J. Thoms, became so popular as to call for the
establishment of a separate society, which publishes a
quarterly journal entitled <i>Folk-lore</i>, and has annually
issued one or more volumes of collections of folk-lore.</p>

<p>In 1844 a new departure was taken by the establishment
of the British Archæological Association, a body
which was intended to take the same place with regard
to archæology that the British Association occupied
with regard to science, holding meetings in various
parts of the country where there existed objects of
specially archæological interest. It held its first meeting
at Canterbury, under the presidency of Lord Albert
Conyngham (afterwards Lord Londesborough), and
arranged its work in four sections&mdash;primæval, mediæval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
architectural, and historical. Before a second meeting
could be held, violent dissensions arose, and the
association split into two. In the result honours were
divided between the two bodies, those who retained the
leadership of Lord Albert retaining also the title of
British Archæological Association; while those who had
for their president the Marquis of Northampton retained
the control of the <i>Archæological Journal</i>, and adopted
the title of "Archæological Institute of Great Britain
and Ireland," to which has since been prefixed the word
"Royal." Both bodies still exist, though the causes of
controversy have long died out.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, County Archæological Societies in
London and greater London began to be formed. In
1846 the Sussex Society, in 1853 the Essex Society, in
1854 the Surrey Society, in 1855 the London and
Middlesex Society, and in 1857 the Kent Society were
established. Each of these societies has published
transactions and other works of solid value. In each
the annual or more frequent excursion to places of
archæological interest within the county is an essential
feature, tending to the dissemination of knowledge and
to the preservation of antiquities, and affording the
advantages of social intercourse. Societies have also
been established for the like purposes within more
restricted areas, as in Hampstead, Battersea, Balham,
Lewisham, Whitechapel, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of merely publishing societies, the Percy, the
Camden, the Shakespeare, and the Arundel have run
their course; but many others, as the Roxburgh, the
Harleian, the New Palæographic, and the Palæontological
still exist to delight their subscribers with the
reproduction of rare works.</p>

<p>In this summary account of the principal Learned
Societies of London it has not been possible to include
many societies of great importance, such as the Colleges
of Physicians and Surgeons, the numerous societies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
connected with other professional pursuits, the Linnæan,
Zoological, Botanical, and other societies devoted to
natural history; the Royal Astronomical Society, which
has important public functions; the Royal Academy, and
other institutions devoted to art. The roll of Learned
Societies is being constantly increased. Among recent
additions may be mentioned the British Academy for
Historical Studies, and the Sociological Society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span></p>

<p class='p3'>From the Borough to St. James's</p>



<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-l.png" width="100" height="123" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Leigh Hunt was of opinion that "one of the best
secrets of enjoyment is the art of cultivating
pleasant associations," and, with his example
before us, we will endeavour to recall some of
those that are to be met with on a walk from the Borough
to St. James's, from one of the poorest parts of our city
to one of the richest. The Borough, dusty, noisy, toil-worn
as it is, is yet, he tells us, "the most classical
ground in the metropolis." From the "Tabard" inn&mdash;now
only a memory, though its contemporary, the
"George," hard by, gives us some idea of its look in
mediæval times&mdash;there rode forth, one bright spring morning,
"Sir Jeffrey Chaucer" and "nyne and twenty"
pilgrims "in a companye ... to wenden on (a)
pilgrimage to Caunterbury with ful devout courage." A
fellow-poet of Chaucer's, John Gower, lies buried close
at hand in Southwark Cathedral, "under a tomb of stone,
with his image of stone also over him." He was one
of the earliest benefactors of this church, then known as
St. Mary Overy, and founded therein a chantry, where
masses should be said for the benefit of his soul. Stones
in the pavement of the choir likewise commemorate John
Fletcher, Philip Massinger, and Edmund Shakespeare,
who lie in unmarked graves somewhere within the
precincts of the cathedral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span></p>

<p>Not a stone's throw from the Borough is the Bankside,
extending from Blackfriars Bridge out beyond Southwark,
a mean and dirty thoroughfare, with the grey Thames
on one side, and on the other dull houses, grimy warehouses,
and gloomy offices. How changed from the semi-rural
resort of Elizabethan days, when swans floated on
the river, and magnificent barges, laden with gaily dressed
nobles and their attendants, were continually passing by!
Great must have been the pleasure traffic then, for
according to Taylor, "the Water Poet," who plied his
trade as waterman and wrote his verses on the Bankside
in the early days of Elizabeth's successor, "the number
of watermen and those that live and are maintained by
them, and by the labour of the oar and scull, between
the bridge of Windsor and Gravesend, cannot be fewer
than forty thousand; the cause of the greater half of
which multitude hath been the players playing on the
Bankside." Besides the players, the brilliant band of
dramatists who shed lustre on the reign of the maiden
Queen frequented it, not only on account of the
pleasantness of its situation, but because of the near
proximity of the theatres, for the Globe, the Rose,
and the Hope all stood on the site now occupied by
the brewery of Messrs. Barclay and Perkins, while the
Swan was not far off. It is a well-authenticated fact that
both Shakespeare and Ben Jonson played at the Globe,
and patronised the "Falcon" tavern, the name of which
still lingers in Falcon Dock and Falcon Wharf, Nos. 79
and 80, Bankside; and while in the meantime they were
producing their masterpieces, Chapman, Dekker, and
Middleton were at the height of their fame, Beaumont
and Fletcher about to begin their career, and Philip
Massinger was newly arrived in town. Some of these
Bankside dramatists were well born and rich&mdash;such as
Francis Beaumont, whose father was a Knight and a
Justice of the Common Pleas; and John Fletcher, who
was a son of the Bishop of London. Others were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
obscure birth and penniless&mdash;like Ben Jonson, who had
been forced to follow the trade of a bricklayer, and
Dekker and Marston, whom he twitted "with their
defective doublet and ravelled satin sleeves," and Philip
Massinger, who in early days went about begging
urgently for the loan of £5. But whatever they had or
lacked, certain it is that their common art levelled all
barriers between them, for though the chief of all the
friendships on the Bankside was that of Beaumont and
Fletcher&mdash;between whom was "a wonderful consimilarity
of fancy ... which caused the dearnesse of friendship
between them so that they lived together on the
Bankside ... (and had) the same cloaths and cloaks
between them"&mdash;yet Massinger collaborated with Fletcher
in at least thirteen plays, with Dekker in one, and with
Ford in two, while Dekker was occasionally associated
with Middleton, and Middleton with Webster and Drayton.
But the Elizabethan dramatists did not confine themselves
to the Bankside; on certain nights they repaired to the
"Mermaid" tavern, which used to stand on the south
side of Cheapside, between Bread and Friday Streets,
to attend the meetings of the famous Mermaid Club,
said to have been founded by Sir Walter Raleigh. Here
were to be found Shakespeare, Spenser, Beaumont,
Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Carew, Donne, and many others,
in eager witty converse. Beaumont well described
the brilliancy of these gatherings in his poem to
Ben Jonson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What things have we seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done at the Mermaid! Heard words that have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So nimble, and so full of subtle flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if that everyone from whence they came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had resolved to live a fool the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his dull life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another favourite haunt of theirs was the "Boar's
Head," which stood on the spot now marked by the statue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
of William IV., at the junction of Eastcheap and Gracechurch
Street. At this tavern Falstaff and Prince Hal
concocted many of their wildest pranks. In later days the
Elizabethan poets and dramatists, led by Ben Jonson, went
even further afield&mdash;to the "Devil" tavern, which stood
at No. 1, Fleet Street, where they held their meetings in
a room called the "Apollo," the chief adornments of which,
a bust of Apollo and a board with an inscription,
"Welcome to the oracle of Apollo," are still to be seen
in an upper room of Messrs. Child's Bank, which now
occupies the site. Ben Jonson tells us that "the first
speech in my 'Catiline,' spoken to <i>Scylla's Ghost</i>, was
writ after I had parted with my friends at the 'Devil'
tavern; I had drank well that night, and had brave
notions."</p>

<p>We have records of the deaths of two at least of
these dramatists on the Bankside&mdash;viz., that of Philip
Massinger, who died "in his own house, near the play-house
on the Bankside," in 1639; and Fletcher, "who dyed
of the plague on the 19th of August, 1625." "The parish
clerk," says Aubrey, "told me that he was his (Fletcher's)
Taylor, and that Mr. Fletcher staying for a suit of cloathes
before he retired into the country, Death stopped his
journey and laid him low there."</p>

<p>Cheapside, so named from the Chepe, or old London
market, along the south side of the site of which it runs,
has been a place of barter ever since the reign of
Henry VI., when a market was held there daily for the
sale of every known commodity. It is easy to see where
the vendors of some of the articles had their stands by
the names of the surrounding streets&mdash;Bread Street, Fish
Street, Milk Street, etc. Later on the stalls were transformed
into permanent shops, with a dwelling-place for
their owners above, and a fair-sized garden at the back.
Despite the commercial spirit that has always pervaded
this region, it has given birth to two famous poets&mdash;the
sweet songster Herrick, who sings in one of his poems of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The golden Cheapside where the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Julia Herrick gave to me my birth,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>golden, perhaps, having reference to his father, who was
a goldsmith; and greater still, John Milton, who first
saw the light in Bread Street, at the sign of the "Spread
Eagle," in a house which was afterwards destroyed in the
Great Fire. It must have been a house of comfortable
dimensions, for it covered the site now occupied by
Nos. 58 to 63, the business premises of a firm who exhibit
a bust of Milton, with an inscription, in a room on their
top floor. Milton's father, moreover, had grown rich in
his profession, which was that of a scrivener, had been
made a Judge, and knighted five years before the birth
of his son, so it is evident the poet began life in easy
circumstances. He was baptised in All Hallows, a church
in Bread Street destroyed in 1897. In Bow Church there
is a tablet in memory of Milton, which was taken from
All Hallows. When he was ten years of age he began
to go to Paul's School, which stood in those days on
the east side of St. Paul's Churchyard, between Watling
Street and Cheapside. Aubrey records that "when he
went to schoole, when he was very young, he studied
very hard, and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or
one o'clock at night, and his father ordered the mayde
to sitt up for him, and at these years (ten) he composed
many copies of verses which might well have become a
riper age." He continued at this school, the old site
of which is marked by a tablet on a warehouse, until he
was sixteen. Some twenty years later Samuel Pepys
was a pupil at Paul's School, and later on in life witnessed
its destruction in the Great Fire. Milton would seem
to have always cherished a great affection for the city,
for after his return from his travels he seldom lived beyond
the sound of Bow Bells, once only venturing as far as
Westminster; and when he died he was buried in St.
Giles's, Cripplegate, in the same grave as his father.
Indeed, the city proper was the birthplace of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
poets, for was not Pope born in Lombard Street, Gray
in Cornhill, and Edmund Spenser in East Smithfield,
while Lord Macaulay spent his earlier years in Birchin
Lane?</p>

</div>

<p>In the narrow confines of Paternoster Row, where the
tall fronts of the houses are so close together that only
a thin strip of sky is visible between them, Charlotte
Brontë and her sister Anne, fresh from the rugged solitudes
of their bleak Yorkshire moors, awoke on the
morning of their first visit to the great capital of which
they had so often dreamed, and, looking out of the dim
windows of the Chapter Coffee-house, saw "the risen
sun struggling through the fog, and overhead above the
house-tops, co-elevate almost with the clouds ... a
solemn orbed mass dark blue and dim the dome" (of
St. Paul's).</p>

<p>Fleet Street has always been the haunt of the
"knights of the pen," and even in these modern days
the names of newspapers stare at the passer-by on every
side, while at every step he jostles an ink-stained satellite
of some great journal. But although these ink-stained
ones are to be met with in Fleet Street at every hour
of the day and night, they do not live there like the
writers of old time&mdash;Michael Drayton, for instance, who
"lived at ye baye-windowe house next the east end of
St. Dunstan's Church"; and Izaak Walton, who kept a
linen-draper's shop "in a house two doors west of the
end of Chancery Lane," and on his infrequent holidays
went a-fishing in the River Lea at Tottenham High
Cross. Abraham Cowley, again, was born over his father's
grocer's shop, which "abutted on Sargeants' Inn," and
here, as a little child, he devoured the <i>Faerie Queen</i>, and
was made "irrecoverably a poet." James Shirley lived
near the Inner Temple Lane; John Locke in Dorset
Court. In Salisbury Square, formerly Salisbury Court,
Thomas Sackville, first Earl of Dorset, the precursor of
Spenser, John Dryden, and Samuel Richardson, all had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
a residence at one time or another. Richardson built a
large printing establishment on the site now occupied
by Lloyd's newspaper offices, where he continued to carry
on business many years after he had removed his private
residence to the West End. He was buried, moreover,
in St. Bride's Church in 1761, a large stone in the nave
between pews 12 and 13 recording the fact. But greatest
and most constant of Fleet Street habitués was Dr.
Johnson. For ten years he lived at 17, Gough Square,
busy in an upper room upon his great Dictionary. Here
he lost his "beloved Tetty," to whose memory he ever
remained faithful. "All his affection had been concentrated
on her. He had neither brother nor sister, neither
son nor daughter." Although twenty years his senior,
with a complexion reddened and coarsened by the too
liberal use of both paint and strong cordials, yet "to
him she was beautiful as the Gunnings, and witty as
Lady Mary." On leaving Gough Square he lived for
a few years in the Temple, where he received his first
visit from Boswell, and made the acquaintance of Oliver
Goldsmith. The latter was then living at 6, Wine Office
Court, Fleet Street, where Johnson, visiting him one
morning in response to an urgent message, found that
"his landlady had arrested him for his rent." He showed
Johnson his MS. of the just-completed <i>Vicar of
Wakefield</i>, which he looked into, and instantly comprehending
its merit, went out and sold it to a bookseller
for sixty pounds. In 1765 Johnson returned to Fleet
Street, and lived for eleven years at 7, Johnson's Court.
Here Boswell dined with him for the first time on Easter
Day, 1773, and found to his surprise "everything in very
good order." Walking up the Court one day in company
with Topham Beauclerk, Boswell confessed to him that
he "had a veneration" for it, because the great doctor
lived there, and was much gratified to learn that Beauclerk
felt the same "reverential enthusiasm." In later years
Dickens stole up this Court one dark December evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
and, with beating heart, dropped his first original MS.
into the letter-box of <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, the office
of which stood on the site now occupied by Mr. Henry
Sell's premises. No. 8, Bolt Court, was the next and last
residence of Dr. Johnson; here, on December 13th, 1784,
he met the inevitable crisis, for which he had always felt
an indescribable terror and loathing, and passed peacefully
and happily away. Johnson had always had a
great predilection for club or tavern life, partly because
it enabled him to escape for a while from the hypochondria
which always dogged his footsteps. He loved nothing
so much as to gather kindred spirits around him and
spend long evenings in congenial conversation. He would
sit, "the Jupiter of a little circle, sometimes indeed nodding
approbation, but always prompt on the slightest contradiction
to launch the thunders of rebuke and sarcasm."
There was not much expense attached to these gatherings,
for it is recorded of one of the clubs he founded that
the outlay was not to exceed sixpence per person an
evening, with a fine of twopence for those who did not
attend. Among the Fleet Street haunts thus frequently
resorted to by Dr. Johnson and his friends were the
"Cocke," patronised in former years by Pepys, and in later
years by Thackeray, Dickens, and Tennyson; the
"Cheshire Cheese," the only house of the kind which
remains as it was in Dr. Johnson's day; the "Mitre," also
formerly patronised by Pepys; and the "Devil," where
the poets laureate had been wont to repair and read their
birthday odes. St. Clement Danes, too, is connected with
Johnson, for, in spite of his love of festivity, he was devout,
and regularly attended this church, occupying pew No. 18
in the north gallery, now marked by a brass plate.
Boswell records that "he carried me with him to the
church of St. Clement Danes, where he had his seat,
and his behaviour was, as I had imagined to myself,
solemnly devout."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span></p>

<p>One more memory of Fleet Street before we leave
it, in connection with Dick's Coffee-house, which used
to stand at Nos. 7 and 8. In December, 1763, the poet
Cowper, then a student in the Inner Temple, was appointed
Clerk of the Journals of the House of Lords. Delicate,
shy, intensely sensitive, and with a strong predisposition
to insanity, the dread of these onerous public duties disturbed
the balance of his morbid brain. His madness
broke out one morning at Dick's, as he himself afterwards
narrated. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At breakfast I read the newspaper, and in it a letter, which the
further I perused it the more closely engaged my attention. I cannot
now recollect the purport of it; but before I had finished it, it appeared
demonstratively true to me that it was a libel or satire upon me. The
author appeared to be acquainted with my purpose of self-destruction,
and to have written that letter on purpose to secure and hasten the
execution of it. My mind probably at this time began to be disordered;
however it was, I was certainly given to a strong delusion. I said within
myself, 'Your cruelty shall be gratified, you shall have your revenge,'
and flinging down the paper in a fit of strong passion, I rushed hastily
out of the room, directing my way towards the fields, where I intended to
find some lane to die in, or if not, determined to poison myself in a ditch,
when I could meet with one sufficiently retired."</p></div>

<p>This paroxysm ended in Cowper trying to hang himself,
but, the rope breaking, he went down to the Thames to
the Custom House Quay and threatened to drown himself.
This attempt, however, also failed, and friends
interfering, he was removed to an asylum, where he
remained eighteen months.</p>

<p>From Fleet Street it is but a step to the Temple, with
its grey quiet corners full of echoing memories, stretching
back even to the days of Shakespeare, whose <i>Twelfth
Night</i> was performed before an audience of his contemporaries
in the self-same Middle Temple Hall that
still confronts us. The names of Henry Fielding,
Edmund Burke, John Gower, Thomas Shadwell, William
Wycherley, Nicholas Rowe, Francis Beaumont, William
Congreve, John Horne Tooke, Thomas Day, Tom Moore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
Sheridan, George Colman, jun., Marston, and Ford, are
all upon the Temple rolls and each must in his day
have been a familiar figure among the ancient buildings.
But Charles Lamb is the presiding genius of the place.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I was born and passed the first seven years of my life in the Temple,"
he tells us. "Its church, its halls, its garden, its fountains, its river
... these are my oldest recollections. Indeed it is the most elegant
spot in the metropolis. What a transition for a countryman visiting
London for the first time, the passing from the crowded Strand or Fleet
Street, by unexpected avenues into its magnificent ample squares, its
classic green recesses. What a cheerful liberal look hath that portion of
it, which from three sides, overlooks the greater gardens, that goodly pile
... confronting with massy contrast, the lighter, older, more
fantastically shrouded one, named of Harcourt, with the cheerful Crown
Office Row (place of my kindly engendure) right opposite the stately
stream, which washes the garden foot.... A man would give something
to have been born in such a place."</p></div>

<p>When Lamb was twenty-five years of age he went back
to live in the Temple, at 16, Mitre Court Buildings, in
an "attic storey for the air." His bed faced the river,
and by "perking on my haunches and supporting my
carcase with my elbows, without much wrying my neck
I can see," he wrote to a friend, "the white sails glide
by the bottom of King's Bench Walk as I lie in my bed."
Here he passed nine happy years, and then, after a short
stay in Southampton Buildings, he returned to the
Temple for the second time, to 4, Inner Temple Lane,
fully intending to pass the remainder of his life within
its precincts. His new set of chambers "looked out
upon a gloomy churchyard-like court, called Hare Court,
with three trees and a pump in it." But fate intervened,
and he and his sister soon after left the Temple, never
to return. It was no easy parting, however, for he wrote
in after years, "I thought we never could have been torn
up from the Temple. Indeed it was an ugly wrench....
We never can strike root so deep in any other
ground."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span></p>

<p>It was when Dr. Johnson had a set of chambers on
the first floor of No. 1, Inner Temple Lane, that Boswell
first went to see him. Boswell wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He received me very courteously, but it must be confessed that his
apartment, furniture, and morning dress were sufficiently uncouth. His
brown suit of clothes looked very rusty, he had on a little old shrivelled
unpowdered wig which was too small for his head, his shirt-neck and
knees of his breeches were loose, his black worsted stockings ill drawn
up, and he had a pair of unbuckled shoes by way of slippers. But all
these slovenly peculiarities were forgotten the moment that he began
to talk."</p></div>

<p>Boswell, indeed, conceived so violent an admiration for
him that he took rooms in Farrar's Buildings in order
to be near him. Oliver Goldsmith seems to have followed
his example, for he went to lodge first in 2, Garden Court,
and afterwards in 2, Brick Court, on the right-hand side,
looking out over the Temple Garden. Thackeray, who,
years afterwards, lodged in the same set of rooms, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have been many a time in the Chambers in the Temple which
were his, and passed up the staircase, which Johnson and Burke and
Reynolds trod to see their friend, their poet, their kind Goldsmith&mdash;the
stair on which the poor women sat weeping bitterly when they heard that
the greatest and most generous of men was dead within the black oak
door."</p></div>

<p>A stone slab with the inscription, "Here lies Oliver
Goldsmith," was placed on the north side of Temple
Church, as near as possible to the spot where he is
supposed to have been buried.</p>

<p>No. 2, Fountain Court, was the last house of William
Blake, the poet-painter, the seer of visions, who had a
set of rooms on the first floor, from whence a glimpse
of the river was to be obtained. It was very poorly
furnished, though always clean and orderly, and decorated
only with his own pictures, but to the eager young
disciples who flocked around him it was "the house of
the Interpreter." When he lay there upon his death-bed,
at the close of a blazing August day in 1827, beautiful
songs in praise of his Creator fell from his lips, and as
his wife, his faithful companion of forty-five years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
struggle and stress, drew near to catch them more distinctly,
he told her with a smile, "My beloved! they are
not mine! no, they are not mine!"</p>

<p>Passing out into the Strand, we are confronted by
the Law Courts. In former days this site was occupied
by a network of streets, one of which was Shire Lane,
where the members of the Kit Cat Club first held their
gatherings, and toasted Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
when, as a child of seven, enthroned on her proud
father's knee, she spent "the happiest hour of her life,"
overwhelmed with caresses, compliments, and sweetmeats.
The famous "Grecian" stood in Devereux Court, and the
"Fountain" where Johnson, on his first arrival in London,
read his tragedy <i>Irene</i> to his fellow-traveller Garrick, on
the site since occupied by Simpson's for several generations.
The Strand "Turk's Head" was at No. 142, and
patronised by Johnson, because "the mistress of it is
a good civil woman and has not much business"; and the
"Coal Hole," immortalised by Thackeray as the "Cave
of Harmony" in <i>The Newcomes</i>, where Terry's Theatre
now uprears its front. But the chief literary association
of the Strand is that of Congreve, who spent his last
years in Surrey Street, "almost blind with cataracts," and
"never rid of the gout," but looking, as Swift wrote to
Stella, "young and fresh and cheerful as ever." He had
always been a favourite with society, and Surrey Street
was thronged by his visitors, among whom were four of
the most beautiful women of the day&mdash;Mrs. Bracegirdle,
Mrs. Oldfield, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and
Henrietta Duchess of Marlborough. Voltaire, too, who
greatly admired his work, sought him out when staying
at the "White Peruke," Covent Garden, and was much
disgusted by the affectation with which Congreve begged
to be regarded as a man of fashion, who produced airy
trifles for the amusement of his idle hours. "If you had
been so unfortunate as to have been a <i>mere</i> gentleman,"
said Voltaire, "I should never have taken the trouble of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
coming to see you." In spite of the looseness of his
life, Congreve had early acquired habits of frugality, and
continuing to practise them when the need for economy
had disappeared, he contrived to amass a fortune of
£10,000, which, on his death in 1789, he bequeathed to
the Duchess of Marlborough, his latest infatuation. This
sum, which would have restored the fallen fortunes of
his nearest relatives, was a mere nothing to the wealthy
beauty, who expended it in the purchase of a magnificent
diamond necklace, which she continually wore in memory
of the dead dramatist.</p>

<p>The whole of Covent Garden is classic ground, from
its association with the wits of Dryden's time, when Bow
Street and Tavistock Street were in turn regarded as
the Bond Street of the fashionable world. Edmund
Waller, William Wycherley, and Henry Fielding, each
lived in Bow Street. In Russell Street stood the three
great coffee-houses of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries&mdash;Wills', Button's, and Tom's. Wills' stood at
No. 21, at the corner of Russell Street and Bow Street;
here Pepys stopped one February evening on his way
to fetch his wife, and heard much "witty and pleasant
discourse"; here Dryden had his special arm-chair, in
winter by the fire, and in summer on the balcony, and
was always ready to arbitrate in any literary dispute. It
is said that Pope, before he was twelve years old, persuaded
his friends to bring him here, so that he might gaze
upon the aged Dryden, the hero of his childish imagination.
Dr. Johnson, Addison, Steele, and Smollett were
all regular visitors. Button's, which stood on the south
side of Russell Street, and Tom's at No. 17, were equally
popular, and the Bedford Coffee-house "under the piazza
in Covent Garden" was another favourite resort.</p>

<p>It was in Russell Street, in the bookshop of Thomas
Davies, the actor, that Boswell had his eagerly desired
first meeting with Dr. Johnson, which he describes as
follows:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At last, on Monday, the 16th of May, when I was sitting in Mr. Davies'
back parlour, after having drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, Johnson
came unexpectedly into the shop, and Mr. Davies having perceived him
through the glass door in the room in which we were sitting advancing
towards us, he announced his awful approach to me somewhat in the
manner of an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addresses Hamlet on
the appearance of his father's ghost: 'Look, my lord, he comes.'"</p></div>

<p>In St. Paul's, Covent Garden, were buried Samuel
Butler, author of <i>Hudibras</i>, Mrs. Centlivre, Thomas
Southerne, John Wolcot, and Wycherley, but when the
church was burned down in 1786 all trace of their graves
disappeared.</p>

<p>One other literary memory before we leave the Strand;
it is connected with what was once No. 30, Hungerford
Stairs (now part of Villiers Street), where stood Warren's
blacking factory, in which the child Dickens passed days
of miserable drudgery, labelling pots of blacking for a
few shillings a week. He describes it in <i>David Copperfield</i>,
under the name of "Murdstone and Grimsby's
warehouse, down in Blackfriars." It was "a crazy old
house, with a wharf of its own, abutting on the water
when the tide was in, and on the mud when the tide was
out, and literally overrun with rats."</p>

<p>Pall Mall, the centre of club-land, in the eighteenth
century was the "ordinary residence of all strangers,"
probably on account of its proximity to the fashionable
chocolate and coffee-houses (the forerunners of the clubs),
which, as Defoe wrote, "were all so close together that
in an hour you could see the company at them all." In
Pall Mall itself were the "Smyrna," the "King's Arms,"
and the "Star and Garter." At the "King's Arms" the
Kit Cat Club met when it had quitted its quarters in
Shire Lane, and at the "Star and Garter" the "Brothers"
were presided over by Swift. The "Tully's Head," a
bookshop kept by the wonderful Robert Dodsley, footman,
poet, dramatist, and publisher, was another favourite
lounging place of the times.</p>

<p>In Charing Cross were the "Rummer," at No. 45, kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
by the uncle of Matthew Prior; Lockett's, two doors
off; the "Turk's Head," next door to No. 17; and the
British Coffee-house, which stood on the site now
occupied by the offices of the London County Council.</p>

<p>In St. James's Street the great coffee and chocolate-houses
positively elbowed each other up and down, just
as the clubs which succeeded them do in the present day.
The "Thatched House," where the Literary Club, founded
by Dr. Johnson, held its meetings under the presidency
of Swift and his contemporaries; the "St. James's," where
Addison "appeared on Sunday nights," and "Swift was
a notable figure," for "those who frequented the place
had been astonished day after day, by the entry of a
clergyman, unknown to any there, who laid his hat on
the table, and strode up and down the room with rapid
steps, heeding no one, and absorbed in his own thoughts.
His strange manner earned him, unknown as he was to all,
the name of the "mad parson""; White's, to which Colley
Cibber was the only English actor ever admitted; and
the "Cocoa Tree," nicknamed the "Wits' Coffee-house,"
which, in Gibbon's time, afforded "every evening a sight
truly English. Twenty or thirty, perhaps, of the finest
men in the kingdom, in point of fashion and fortune,
supping at little tables covered with a napkin, in the
middle of a coffee-room, upon a bit of cold meat or
a sandwich and drinking a glass of punch."</p>

<p>Lord Byron was the most romantic literary figure
connected with St. James's Street. His first home in
London, after his youthful days, was at No. 8, where
he went to live after the publication of his <i>English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers</i>. From this house the proud
and gloomy young man set forth to take his seat in the
House of Lords as a peer of the realm. Moore wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In a state more alone and unfriended, perhaps, than any youth of
his high station had ever before been reduced to on such an occasion&mdash;not
having a single individual of his own class, either to take him by the
hand as friend, or acknowledge him as an acquaintance."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span></p></div>

<p>But this state of affairs was not to endure. On February
29th, 1812, <i>Childe Harold</i> appeared.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The effect was electric; his fame had not to wait for any of the
ordinary gradations, but seemed to spring up like the palace of a fairy
tale&mdash;in a night.... From morning till night flattering testimonies
of his success reached him; the highest in the land besieged his door, and
he who had been so friendless found himself the idol of London society."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps we cannot do better than end these literary
associations of club-land with a few words about a man
who in his time was one of its most brilliant figures&mdash;Theodore
Hook. When he was released from the King's
Bench prison, with his debt to the Crown still hanging
over him,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"he took a large and handsome house in Cleveland Row. Here he
gave dinners on an extensive scale, and became a member of all the best
clubs, particularly frequenting those where high play was the rule. His
visiting book included all that was loftiest and gayest and in every sense
most distinguished in London society. The editor of <i>John Bull</i>, the
fashionable novelist, the wittiest and most vivid talker of the time, his
presence was not only everywhere welcome but everywhere coveted and
clamoured for. But the whirl of extravagant dissipation emptied his
pocket, fevered his brain, and shortened the precious hours in which alone
his subsistence could be gained."</p></div>

<p>In the height of his social triumphs there always hung
inexorably over him the Damocles sword of debt. When
at last he gave way under the strain, and went into comparative
retirement at Fulham, the number of dinners at
the Athenæum Club, where he had always had a particular
table kept for him near the door (nicknamed Temperance
Corner), fell off by upwards of three hundred per annum.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Few old mansions in the city of London could
rival the ancient dwelling-place of the brave
old knight, Sir John Crosby. Its architectural
beauties and historical associations endeared it
to all lovers of old London, and many a groan was heard
when its fate was doomed, and the decree went forth
that it was to be numbered among the departed glories
of the city. Unhappily, the hand of the destroyer could
not be stayed, and the earnest hope had to be abandoned
that many a generation of Londoners might be permitted
to see this relic of ancient civic life, and to realise from
this example the kind of dwelling-place wherein the city
merchants of olden days made their homes, and the
salient features of mediæval domestic architecture.
Shorn of its former magnificence, reduced to a fraction
of its original size, it retained evidences of its ancient
state and grandeur, and every stone and timber told of
its departed glories, and of the great events of which
Crosby Hall had been the scene. It has been associated
with many a name that shines forth in the annals of
English history, and imagination could again people the
desolate hall with a gay company of courtiers and
conspirators, of knights and dames, of city merchants
gorgeous in their liveries of "scarlet and green," or
"murrey and plunket," when pomp and pageantry,
tragedy and death, dark councils and mirth, and gaiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
and revellings followed each other through the portals
of the mansion in one long and varied procession. It
will be our pleasure to recall some of these scenes which
were enacted long ago, and to tell of the royal, noble,
and important personages who made this house their
home.</p>

<p>Many people who live in our great overgrown modern
London&mdash;who dwell in the West End, and never wander
further east than Drury Lane Theatre or St. Pancras
Station&mdash;have never seen Crosby Hall, and know not
where it stood. If you go along Cheapside and to
the end of Cornhill, and then turn to the left, up
Bishopsgate, the old house stood on the right hand side;
or you may approach along Holborn and London Wall.
Alas! the pilgrimage is no longer possible. Bishopsgate
is historic ground. The name is derived from the
ancient gate of the city that was built, according
to Stow, by some Bishop of London, "though now
unknown when or by whom, for ease of passengers
toward the east, and by north, as into Norfolk, Suffolk,
Cambridgeshire, &amp;c." Some authorities name Bishop
Erkenwald, son of King Offa, as the first builder of
Bishopsgate, and state that Bishop William, the
Norman, repaired the gate in the time of his namesake,
the Conqueror. Henry III. confirmed to the German
merchants of the Hanse certain liberties and privileges,
which were also confirmed by Edward I. in the tenth
year of his reign, when it was discovered that the
merchants were bound to repair the gate. Thereupon
Gerald Marbod, alderman of the Hanse, and other Hanse
merchants, granted 210 marks sterling to the Mayor and
citizens, and covenanted that they and their successors
should from time to time repair the gate. In 1479, in
the reign of Edward IV., it was entirely rebuilt by
these merchants, and was a fine structure adorned with
the effigies of two bishops, probably those named above,
and with two other figures supposed to represent King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
Alfred and Alred, Earl of Mercia, to whom Alfred
entrusted the care of the gate. This repair was probably
necessary on account of the assault of the bastard
Falconbridge on this and other gates of the city, who
shot arrows and guns into London, fired the suburbs,
and burnt more than three-score houses. The gate has
been frequently repaired and rebuilt, its last appearance
being very modern, with a bishop's mitre on the
key-stone of the arch, and surmounted by the city arms
with guarding griffins. London "improvements" have
banished the gate, as they have so many other interesting
features of the city.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood is interesting. Foremost among
the attractions of Bishopsgate Street is the beautiful
church of St. Helen, formerly the church of the Nunnery
of St. Helen, the Westminster of the city, where lie so
many illustrious merchants and knights and dames, and
amongst them the founder of Crosby Hall and other
owners of the mansion. The church is closely associated
with the hall. There in that fine house they lived.
There in the church hard by their bodies sleep, and their
gorgeous tombs and inscriptions tell the story of their
deeds. St. Helen's Church was one of the few which
escaped destruction at the Great Fire of London.
There was an early Saxon church here, but the earliest
parts of the existing building date back to the thirteenth
century. There are some blocked-up lancet windows of
the transept, a staircase doorway in the south-east corner,
another doorway which led from the nun's choir into the
convent, and a lancet window. There is a Renaissance
porch, the work of Inigo Jones, erected in 1663. The
main part of the structure is Decorated and Perpendicular,
the fifteenth century work being due to the builder of
Crosby Hall, who left 500 marks for its restoration and
improvement. The whole church possesses many
interesting features, of which want of space prevents a
full description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Sir John Crosby determined to seek a site for his
house close to this church and the Nunnery of St. Helen,
and in 1466 obtained a lease from Alice Ashford, prioress
of the Nunnery, of some lands and tenements for a period
of ninety-nine years for the yearly rent of £11 6s. 8d.
Doubtless many good citizens of London in the present
day would like to make so good a bargain.</p>

<p>Sir John Crosby, whose honoured name is preserved to
this day by the noble house which he built, was a worthy
and eminent citizen of London&mdash;one of the men who
laid the foundations of English trade and commercial
pre-eminence. He attained to great wealth, and his
actions and his bequests prove that he was a very worthy
man. Some idle story stated that, like the famous Dick
Whittington, he was of humble origin and unknown
parentage. Stow says: "I hold it a fable said of him,
to be named Crosby, from his being found by a cross."
A very pretty conceit! He was discovered, when an
infant, or having attained the age of boyhood, sleeping
on the steps of the market cross at Cheapside or Charing;
and the sympathetic folk who found him there named him
Cross-by! Our ancestors, like ourselves, loved a romance,
a nice cheerful story of a poor boy attaining to rank and
opulence, marrying his master's daughter and doing brave
deeds for his King and country. The notable career of
Sir Richard Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of London,
was so embellished with romantic incident. He was no
poor man's son who begged his way to London,
accompanied by his favourite cat. Was he not the
youngest son of Sir William Whittington, the owner of
Pauntley Manor in Gloucestershire, and of Solers Hope,
Hereford? and was not his famous cat the name of his
ship which brought him wealth and affluence? Or shall
we accept the story of the sale of the cat to the King
of Barbary? So the legend of the foundling Crosby is
equally a fable, woven by the skilful imaginations of
our Elizabethan forefathers. Sir John came of goodly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
parentage. There was a Johan de Crosbie, King's Clerk
in Chancery, in the time of Edward II.; a Sir John
Crosbie, Knight, and Alderman of London, in the reign
of Edward III.; and a John Crosby, Esquire, and servant
of King Henry IV., who gave to him the wardship of
Joan, daughter and sole heir of John Jordaine,
Fishmonger&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a member of the Worshipful Company
of Fishmongers of the City of London. This John
Crosby was, according to Stow, either the father or
grandfather of the builder of Crosby Hall.</p>

<p>The family held the manor and advowson of the
church of Hanworth-on-the-Thames, not far from
Hampton Court. This manor was owned by the Sir John
Crosbie who lived in the time of King Edward III., and
after his death it was placed in the hands of a certain
Thomas Rigby for safe custody until John Crosbie, the
son and heir of the knight, should have grown up to
man's estate and attained his majority. This estate
seems afterwards to have passed into the hands of King
Henry VIII., who, on account of its pleasant situation,
delighted in it above any other of his houses.</p>

<p>The father of the founder of the Hall was a friend
of Henry Lord Scrope, of Masham, the unfortunate
nobleman who was beheaded at Southampton for
complicity in a plot against the life of Henry V. He
bequeathed to his friend, John Crosbie, "a woollen gown
without furs and one hundred shillings."</p>

<p><i>Bene natus</i>, <i>bene vestitus</i>, and doubtless <i>modice
doctus</i>, the qualifications of an All Souls' Fellow, John
Crosby began his career, embarking in trade and
commerce, and undertaking the duties of a worthy citizen
of London. The palmy days of commercial enterprise
inaugurated by King Henry VII. had not yet set in.
Before his time the trade between England and the
Continent was much more in the hands of foreigners than
of English merchants. English trading ships going
abroad to sell English goods and bring back cargoes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
foreign commodities were few in number. The English
merchant usually stayed at home, and sold his wares
to the strangers who came each year to London and the
other trading ports, or bartered them for the produce of
other lands, with which their ships were freighted. The
German Hanse merchants, the Flemish traders, the
Lombards, and many others, enjoyed great privileges in
their commerce with England. But, in spite of this, men
like Crosby were able to amass wealth and make large
profits. Sir John's dealings extended far into other
countries, and he had important connections with the
Friscobaldi of Florence, who with the Medici were the
great bankers and engrossers of the commerce of Europe.</p>

<p>Of the great merchants who laid the foundations of
our English commerce we often know little more than
their names, the offices they held, with a meagre catalogue
of their most philanthropic labours and their wills. It
is possible, however, to gather a little more information
concerning the owner of Crosby Place. The records at
Guildhall tell us that in 1466, the seventh year of
Edward IV., John Crosby, Grocer, was elected with three
others a Member of Parliament. He was also elected in
the same year one of the auditors of the City and Bridge
House. In 1468 we find him elected Alderman of Broad
Street Ward, and two years later Sheriff of London.
He took a prominent part in the old city life of London,
and was a prominent member of two of the old City
Companies, the Grocers and the Woolmen. Of the former
he twice served the office of warden, and preserved a
strong affection for his company, bequeathing to it by
his will considerable gifts. The honourable and
important post of Mayor of the Staple at Calais was
also conferred upon him.</p>

<p>He seems to have been a brave and valiant man, as
well as a successful trader and good citizen. During his
time the safety of the City of London was endangered
owing to the attack of Thomas Nevil, the bastard Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
Falconbridge, to which reference has already been made.
Stow tells the story graphically. This filibusterer came
with his rebel company and a great navy of ships near
to the Tower&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Whereupon the mayor and aldermen fortified all along the Thames
side, from Baynard's Castle to the Tower, with armed men, guns and other
instruments of war, to resist the invasion of the mariners, whereby the
Thames side was safely preserved and kept by the aldermen and other
citizens that assembled thither in great numbers. Whereupon the rebels,
being denied passage through the city that way, set upon Aeldgate,
Bishopsgate, Criplegate, Aeldersgate, London Bridge, and along the river
of Thames, shooting arrows and guns into the city, fired the suburbs, and
burnt more than three score houses. And farther, on Sunday, the eleventh
of May, five thousand of them assaulting Aeldgate, won the bulwarks, and
entered the city; but the portclose being let down, such as had entered were
slain, and Robert Basset, portcullis alderman of Aeldgate ward, with the
recorder, commanded in the name of God to draw up the portclose; which
being done, they issued out, and with sharp shot and fierce fight, put their
enemies back so far as St. Bottolph's Church, by which time Earl Rivers, and
lieutenant of the Tower, was come with a fresh company, which joining
together discomfited the rebels, and put them to flight, whom the said Rober,
Basset with the other citizens chased to the Mile's End, and from thence,
some to Poplar, some to Stratford, slew many, and took many of them
prisoners. In which space the Bastard, having assayed other places on the
water side, and little prevailed, fled toward his ships."</p></div>

<p>In this determined defence of the city against a
formidable attack, John Crosbie took a leading part,
bravely contending against the forces of the foe and
fighting fiercely. Twelve aldermen with the recorder
were knighted in the field by King Edward IV., and
amongst those so honoured were the Lord Mayor of
London, William Taylor, and John Crosby. Our hero
was no carpet knight, no poor-spirited tradesman and
man of peace. Like many other famous citizens of his
age, he could don his armour and fight for his King
and country, and proved himself a gallant leader of a
citizen army, the best sort of army in the world. He
was a devoted adherent of the House of York, and a
favourite of Edward IV., who sent him on an important
embassage to the Duke of Burgundy, who had married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
Elizabeth of York, the King's sister. The secret object of
the mission was an alliance against Francis I. of France.
The embassy was also sent to the Duke of Brittany with
the same object, and also to secure the persons of the
Earls of Richmond and Pembroke, who had taken refuge
in France, and there felt themselves secure. The future
Richard III. was nearly persuaded to return to
England; his foot was almost on the ship's deck, when,
fortunately for him, his voyage was prevented. If he
had continued his journey he would never have worn
a crown, as he would have lacked a head whereon to
place it.</p>

<p>Sir John Crosby not long before his death began to
build the beautiful house in Bishopsgate "in the place
of certain tenements, with their appurtenances let to him
by Alice Ashfield, Prioress of St. Helen's....
This house he built of stone and timber, very large and
beautiful, and the highest at that time in London," as
Stow records. The whole structure was known as Crosby
Place, and rivalled the dimensions of a palace. All
that remained of this magnificent building was the Hall,
together with the Council Room and an ante-room,
forming two sides of a quadrangle. It was built of stone,
and measured 54 feet by 27 feet, and was 40 feet in height.
The Hall was lighted by a series of eight Perpendicular
windows on one side and six on the other, and by a
beautifully-constructed octagonal bay window. It had a
fine roof of exquisite workmanship richly ornamented, and
a wide chimney. Much of the original stone pavement
had vanished. The Council Chamber was nearly as large
as the hall, being only 14 feet less in length.</p>

<p>Crosby Hall has been the scene of many notable
historic scenes. In the play of "Edward IV." by
Heywood, Sir John Crosby figures as Lord Mayor of
London, a position which he never occupied, and the
King dines with him and the Alderman after the defeat
of the rebel Falconbridge at Crosby Hall. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
just received the honour of knighthood, and thus
muses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ay, marry, Crosby! this befits thee well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some will marvel that, with scarlet gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wear a gilded rapier by my side."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is quite possible that the King thus dined with his
favourite, but there is no historical account that confirms
the poet's play. The builder did not long enjoy his
beautiful house, and died in 1475, leaving a second wife
and a daughter by his first wife, whom he seemed to
have loved with a more ardent affection than his second
spouse. Soon after his death the man whom he tried
to trap in France, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, came to
reside here, and made it the scene of endless plots and
conspiracies against his luckless nephews and his many
enemies. Crosby Place is frequently alluded to by
Shakespeare in his play, "Richard the Third."
Gloucester tells Catesby to report to him at Crosby Place
the treacherous murder of the Princes in the Tower, and
he bids the Lady Anne to "presently repair to Crosby
Place."</p>

<p class='center'><i>Engraved by Pugh, 1804.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The house in 1502 passed into the possession of Sir
Bartholomew Reed, Lord Mayor, and then to John Best,
Alderman, from whom it was purchased by Sir Thomas
More, the famous Lord Chancellor. Doubtless it was in
the chambers of Crosby Place that he wrote his <i>Utopia</i>.
He sold the lease to his beloved friend, Antonio
Bonvisi, an Italian gentleman, who had long lived in
England; and when the Dissolution of Monasteries took
place, and the possessions of the Priory of St. Helen's
were seized by the Crown, the King allowed the Italian
to retain possession of Crosby Place. We need not
record all its worthy owners. It was frequently used as
a fitting place for the lodging of foreign ambassadors,
and here Sir John Spencer, having restored the house,
kept his mayoralty in 1594. Enormously wealthy, he
lived in great splendour and entertained lavishly. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
was a great favourite of Queen Elizabeth. It was not
from Crosby Hall, but from his house at Canonbury, that
his only daughter effected her escape in a baker's basket
in order to wed the handsome Lord Compton. Terrible
was the father's wrath, and everyone knows the charming
story of the Queen's tactful intervention, how she induced
Sir John to stand as sponsor with her for an unknown
boy, whom Sir John declared should be the heir of
all his wealth, and how this boy was, of course, Lady
Compton's child, and how a full reconciliation was
effected. It is a very pretty story. It is not so pleasant
to read of the disastrous effect of the possession of so
much wealth had on the brain of Lord Compton, when
he came into possession of his lady's riches. She was
a little vixenish, spoilt and exacting, if she really
intended seriously the literal meaning of that well-known
letter which she wrote setting forth her needs and
requirements. It is too long to quote. Lord Compton
was created Earl of Northampton, and that precious child
of his when he grew to man's estate was killed fighting
for the Royalist cause in the Civil War.</p>

<p>During that disastrous time Crosby became a prison
for Royalists, and later on a great part of the house
was destroyed by fire, and its ancient glories
departed. For a hundred years the Hall was used as
a Nonconformist chapel. In 1778 part of the premises
was converted into a place of business by Messrs. Holmes
and Hall, the rest being used as private dwellings. It
provided a model for the banqueting-hall of Arundel
Castle, and some of the carved stones of the Council
Chamber were removed to Henley-upon-Thames to adorn
a dairy. Alien buildings soon covered the site of the
destroyed portion of the old house. In 1831 it was left
forlorn and untenanted, and in a state of considerable
decay. Then arose a considerable excitement, of which
the struggle of the present year reminds us. Crosby
Hall was doomed. But zealous lovers of the antiquities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
of the city determined to try to save it. An appeal
was made, and a restoration fund started, though, like
many other restoration funds, it proved itself inadequate.
A benevolent lady, Miss Hackett, gallantly came to the
rescue, and practically saved Crosby Hall. Her idea
was to convert it into a lecture hall for the Gresham
Professors; but this plan came to nothing, though the
building was repaired, the south wall of the Throne
and Council Chambers being rebuilt. Then a company
was formed to take over Miss Hackett's interest, and the
Crosby Hall Literary and Scientific Institution was
formed, but that scheme came to nothing. Then it was
bought by Messrs. F. Gordon &amp; Co., who restored the
building, attached to it an annex of half-timbered
construction, and converted the premises into a
restaurant. Thus it remained for several years.
Recently the site was acquired by a banking company,
and its demolition was threatened. Immediate action
was taken by Sir Vesey Strong, the Lord Mayor, and
others, to save the building. The fight was fought
strenuously and bravely. Apathy was found in some
quarters where it would least have been expected, and
all efforts were fruitless. It is deplorable to have to
record that the last of the mansions of the old city
magnates has been allowed to disappear, and that Crosby
Hall is now only a memory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span></p>

<p class="drop-cap">We have stated in the Preface that London
needs no pageant or special spectacular
display in order to set forth its wonderful
attractions. London is in itself a pageant,
far more interesting than any theatrical representation;
and in this final chapter we will enumerate some of
those other features of Old London life which have
not found description in the preceding pictures. We
will "stand by and let the pageant pass," or, rather,
pass along the streets and make our own pageant.</p>

<p>The great city is always changing its appearance,
and travellers who have not seen it for several years
scarcely know where they are when visiting some of
the transformed localities. But however great the
change, the city still exercises its powerful fascination
on all who have once felt its strangely magnetic force,
its singular attractiveness. Though the London County
Council have effected amazing "improvements,"
constructing a street which nobody wants and nobody
uses, and spending millions in widening Piccadilly;
though private enterprise pulls down ancient dwellings
and rears huge hotels and business premises in their
places&mdash;it is still possible to conjure up the memories
of the past, and to picture to ourselves the multitudinous
scenes of historic interest which Old London has
witnessed. Learned writers have already in these
volumes enabled us to transport ourselves at will to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
the London of bygone times&mdash;to the mediæval city,
with its monasteries, its churches, its palaces, its
tragedies; to Elizabethan London, bright and gay, with
young life pulsing through its veins; to the London of
Pepys, with its merry-makings, its coarseness, and its
vice. In this concluding chapter we will recall some
other memories, and try to fill the background to the
picture.</p>

<p>Westminster, the rival city, the city of the court,
with its abbey and its hall, we have not attempted to
include in our survey. She must be left in solitary state
until, perhaps, a new volume of this series may presume
to describe her graces and perfections. The ever-growing
suburbs of the great city, the West End, the
fashionable quarter, Southern London across the river,
with Lambeth and its memories of archbishops&mdash;all this,
and much else that deserves an honoured place in the
chronicles of the metropolis, we must perforce omit in
our survey. Some of the stories are too modern to
please the taste of those who revel in the past; and if
the curious reader detects omissions, he may console
himself by referring to some of the countless other books
and guides which the attractions of London are ever
forcing industrious scribes to produce.</p>

<p>Many regrets were expressed when it was found
necessary to remove this ancient school from London,
and to destroy the old buildings. Of course, "everything
is for the best in this best of possible worlds."
Boys, like plants, thrive better in the open country,
and London fogs are apt to becloud the brain as well
as injure health. But the antiquary may be allowed
to utter his plaint over the demolition of the old features
of London life. The memorials of this ancient school
cannot be omitted from our collection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span></p>

<p>We are carried back in thought to the Friars, clad
in grey habits, girt with cord, and sandal shod, who
settled in the thirteenth century on the north side of
what we now call Newgate Street, and, by the generosity
of pious citizens, founded their monastery. Thus John
Ewin gave them the land in the ward of Farringdon
Without, and in the parish of St. Nicholas Shambles;
William Joyner built the choir; William Wallis the
nave; William Porter the chapter house; Gregory
Bokesby the dormitories, furnishing it with beds;
Bartholomew de Castello the refectory, where he feasted
the friars on St. Bartholomew's Day. Queen Margaret,
the second wife of Edward I., was a great benefactor
of the order, and advanced two thousand marks towards
the cost of a large church, which was completed in
1327, and was a noble structure, 300 feet in length,
89 feet in breadth, and 74 feet high. "Dick"
Whittington built for the friars a splendid library, which
was finished in 1424. The church was the favoured
resting-place of the illustrious dead. Four queens, four
duchesses, four countesses, one duke, two earls, eight
barons, and some thirty-five knights reposed therein.
In the choir there were nine tombs of alabaster and
marble, surrounded by iron railings, and monuments
of marble and brass abounded. The dissolution of
monasteries came with greedy Henry, and the place was
rifled. The crown seized the goodly store of treasure;
the church became a receptacle for the prizes taken
from the French; and Sir Martin Bowes, Mayor of
London, for the sum of £50, obtained all the beautiful
tombs and brasses, marble and alabaster, which were
carted away from the desecrated shrine.</p>

<p>But Henry's conscience smote him. The death of
Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, the King's boon
companion, moved him "to bethink himself of his end,
and to do some good work thereunto," as Fuller states.
The church was reopened for worship, and Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
Ridley, preaching at Paul's Cross, announced the
King's gift of the conventual grounds and buildings,
with the hospital of St. Bartholomew, for the relief
of the poor. Letters patent were issued in 1545, making
over to the Mayor and Commonalty of London for ever
"the Grey Friars' Church, with all the edifices and
ground, the fratry, library, dortor, chapter-house, great
cloister, and the lesser tenements and vacant grounds,
lead, stone, iron, etc.; the hospital of
St. Bartholomew, West Smithfield,
the church of the same, the lead, bells,
and ornaments of the same hospital,
with all messuages, tenements, and
appurtenances."</p>

<p>It was a poor return to the Church
for all of that the King had robbed
her. Moreover, he did not altogether
abandon a little profit. He made the
monastic church, now called the Christ
Church, do duty for the parishes
of St. Nicholas in the Shambles,
St. Ewins, and part of St. Sepulchre,
uniting these into one parish, and
pulling down the churches of the first
two parishes. It would be curious
to discover what became of the
endowments of these parishes, and of
the fabrics.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'>Carrying the Crug-basket</p></div>
</div>

<p>For some years nothing was done to further the
cause of this charity, but in 1552, when Bishop Ridley,
who was a mightily convincing preacher, was discoursing
upon charity before Edward VI., the boy-King was so
moved that he conversed with the bishop, and, together
with the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the city,
determined to found three hospitals&mdash;Christ's Hospital
for the education of poor children, St. Thomas's for the
relief of the sick and diseased, and Bridewell for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
correction and amendment of the idle and the vagabond.
Before his last illness, Edward had just strength enough
to sign the charter for the founding of these institutions,
ejaculating: "Lord, I yield Thee most hearty thanks
that Thou hast given me life thus long to finish this
work to the glory of Thy name." The good citizens of
London, with their accustomed charity, immediately set
to work, before the granting of the charter, to subscribe
money for the repair of the old monastic buildings, and
in 1552 three hundred and forty children were admitted,
not so much for educational purposes as for their rescue
from the streets, and the provision of shelter, food, and
clothing. It must have been a welcome sight to the
citizens to see them clothed in livery of russet cotton,
the boys with red caps, the girls with kerchiefs on their
heads, lining the procession when the Lord Mayor and
aldermen rode to St. Paul's on Christmas Day. On the
following Easter the boys and "mayden children" were
in "plonket," or blue&mdash;hence the hospital derived the
name of the Blue Coat School. The dress of the boys,
concerning the origin of which many fanciful interpretations
have been made, is the costume of the period
generally worn by apprentices and serving men,
consisting of a long blue coat, with leathern girdle, a
sleeveless yellow waistcoat and yellow stockings, clerical
bands and a small black cap completing the dress.
"Four thousand marks by the year" from the royal
exchequer were granted by the King for the maintenance
of the school, which sum was largely supplemented by
the citizens and other pious benefactors, such as Lady
Ramsay, who founded "a free writing schoole for poor
men's children" at the hospital. Camden says that at
the beginning of the seventeenth century six hundred
children were maintained and educated, and one thousand
two hundred and forty pensioners relieved by the hospital
in alms, and, later on, as many as one thousand one
hundred and twenty children were cared for by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
institution. The governors, moreover, started "place
houses" in other districts&mdash;at Hertford, Ware, Reading,
and Bloxburn&mdash;where boys were educated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image_037.jpg" width="300" height="227" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class='center'>Wooden Platters and Beer Jack.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The buildings were greatly injured by the fire of
1666, when the old monastic church was entirely
destroyed. The great hall was soon rebuilt by Sir John
Frederick, and then the famous Royal Mathematical
School was founded through the exertions of Sir Robert
Clayton, Sir Jonas Moore, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir
Charles Scarbrough, and Samuel Pepys. King Charles II.
granted a charter and £1,000 a year for seven years,
and the forty boys who composed the school were called
"King's boys." They were instructed in navigation, and
wore a badge on the left shoulder. A subordinate
mathematical school, consisting of twelve scholars,
denoted "the Twelves," who wore a badge on the right
shoulder, was subsequently formed. Pepys took a keen
interest in the school, and a series of a large number
of his letters is in existence which show the efforts
he made to maintain the mathematical school. He tells
also of a little romance connected with the hospital,
which is worth recording. There was at that time a
grammar school for boys and a separate school for
girls. Two wealthy citizens left their estates, one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
a bluecoat boy, and the other to a bluecoat girl. Some
of the governors thought that it would be well if these
two fortunate recipients were married. So a public
wedding was arranged at the Guildhall chapel, where
the ceremony was performed by the Dean of St. Paul's,
the bride, supported by two bluecoat boys, being given
away by the Lord Mayor, and the bridegroom, attired
in blue satin, being led to the altar by two bluecoat
girls.</p>

</div>

<p>A noble gift of Sir Robert Clayton enabled the
governors to rebuild the east cloister and south front.
The writing school was erected by Sir Christopher Wren
in 1694, at the expense of Sir John Moore. The ward
over the east side cloister was rebuilt in 1705 by Sir
Francis Child, the banker, and in 1795 the grammar
school was erected. Some of the buildings of the old
monastery survived until the beginning of the last
century, but they were somewhat ruinous and unsafe,
hence, in 1803, a great building fund was formed. The
hall erected after the great fire was pulled down, and
a vast building in the Tudor style begun in 1825, which
was so familiar to all who passed along the eastern
end of Holborn. John Shaw was the architect. You
will remember the open arcade, the buttresses and
octagonal towers, and the embattled and pinnacled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
walls, and, above all, you will remember the crowd of
happy boys, clad in their picturesque garb, kicking about
the merry football. The dining hall was one of the
finest rooms in London, being 187 feet long, 51 feet wide,
and 47 feet high; lighted by nine large windows, those
on the south side being filled with stained glass. There
hung the huge charter picture, representing Edward VI.
presenting the charter to the Lord Mayor, the Chancellor,
officers of State, and children of the school being in
attendance. This picture has been attributed to Holbein,
but since the event occurred in 1553, and that artist
could have produced no work later than 1534, the
tradition is erroneous. Two portraits of Edward VI.
are also in the possession of the hospital attributed to
Holbein, but they have been proved to be the work of
a later artist. Verrio's portrait of Charles II., and his
picture of James II. receiving the mathematical boys,
are very large canvases.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe all the buildings which
so recently existed, but have now been swept away.
It is more interesting to note some of the curious
customs which exist or formerly existed in the school,
and some of the noted of the old "Blues." Christ's
Hospital was a home of old customs, some of them,
perhaps, little relished by the scholars. Each boy had
a wooden "piggin" for drinking small beer served out
of a leathern or wooden jack; a platter, spoon, and
soup-ladle of the same material. There was a quaint
custom of supping in public on Sundays during Lent,
when visitors were admitted, and the Lord Mayor or
president of the governors sat in state. Quaint wooden
candlesticks adorned the tables, and, after the supper,
were carried away in procession, together with the
tablecloths, crug-baskets, or baskets used for carrying
bread, bowls, jacks, and piggins. Before the supper a
hymn was sung, and a "Grecian," or head boy, read
the prayers from the pulpit, silence being enforced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
three blows of a wooden hammer. The supper then
began, consisting of bread and cheese, and the visitors
used to walk about between the tables. Then followed
the solemn procession of the boys carrying their goods,
and bowing repeatedly to the governors and their guests.
It was a pleasing custom, honoured by the presence of
many distinguished guests, and Queen Victoria and Prince
Albert on one occasion witnessed the spectacle.</p>

<img src="images/image_039.jpg" width="600" height="441" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">Christ's Hospital: the Garden.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Then there were the annual orations on St. Matthew's
Day, commemorating the foundation of the school, and
attended by the civic magnates. A state service was
held in Christ Church, Newgate Street, and, afterwards,
the Grecians delivered speeches, and a collection was
made for the support of these headboys when they went
to the University. The beadles delivered up their staves
to the Court, and if no fault was found with these officers
their badges were returned to them. The Company was
regaled with "sweet cakes and burnt wine."</p>

<p>At Easter there were solemn processions&mdash;first, on
Easter Monday, to the Mansion House, when the Lord
Mayor was escorted by the boys to Christ Church to
hear the Spital or hospital sermon. On Easter Tuesday
again the scholars repaired to the Mansion House, and
were regaled with a glass of wine, in lieu of which
lemonade, in more recent times, could be obtained, two
buns, and a shilling fresh from the Mint, the senior
scholars receiving an additional sum, and the Grecians
obtained a guinea. Again the Spital sermon was
preached. The boys were entitled, by ancient custom,
to sundry privileges&mdash;to address the sovereign on his
visiting the city, and the "King's boys" were entitled
to be presented at the first drawing-room of the season,
to present their charts for inspection, and to receive
sundry gifts. By ancient privilege they were entitled to
inspect all the curiosities in the Tower of London free
of any charge, and these at one time included a miniature
zoological garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Many are the notable men renowned in literature and
art who have sprung from this famous school. Charles
Lamb, S. T. Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, and countless other
men might be mentioned who have done honour to their
school. Some of their recollections of old manners
reveal some strange educational methods&mdash;the severe
thrashings, the handcuffing of runaways, the confining
in dungeons, wretched holes, where the boys could just
find room to lie down on straw, and were kept in solitary
confinement and fed worse than prisoners in modern
gaols. Bread and beer breakfasts were hardly the best
diet for boys, and the meat does not always appear
to have been satisfactory. However, all these bygone
abuses have long ago disappeared. For some years the
future of the hospital was shrouded in uncertainty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
At length it was resolved to quit London, and now
the old buildings have been pulled down, and the school
has taken a new lease of life and settled at Horsham,
where all will wish that it may have a long and
prosperous career. We may well conclude this brief
notice of the old school in the words of the School
Commissioners of 1867, who stated: "Christ's Hospital
is a thing without parallel in the country and <i>sui generis</i>.
It is a grand relic of the mediæval spirit&mdash;a monument
of the profuse munificence of that spirit, and of that
constant stream of individual beneficence, which is so
often found to flow around institutions of that character.
It has kept up its main features, its traditions, its
antique ceremonies, almost unchanged, for a period of
upwards of three centuries. It has a long and goodly
list of worthies." We know not how many of these
antique ceremonies have survived its removal, but we
venture to hope that they may still exist, and that the
authorities have not failed to maintain the traditions
that Time has consecrated.</p>


<h3>The City Churches</h3>

<p>In the pageant of London no objects are more
numerous and conspicuous than the churches which greet
us at every step. In spite of the large number which
have disappeared, there are very many left. There they
stand in the centre of important thoroughfares, in obscure
courts and alleys&mdash;here surrounded by high towering
warehouses; there maintaining proud positions, defying
the attacks of worldly business and affairs. A whole
volume would be required to do justice to the city
churches, and we can only glance at some of the most
striking examples.</p>

<p>The Great Fire played havoc with the ancient
structures, and involved in its relentless course many
a beautiful and historic church. But some few of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
are left to us. We have already seen St. Bartholomew's,
Smithfield, and glanced at the church of St. Helen,
Bishopsgate, and old St Paul's. Wren's St. Paul's
Cathedral has so often been described that it is not
necessary to tell again the story of its building.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
"Destroyed by the Great Fire, rebuilt by Wren," is the
story of most of the city churches; but there were some
few which escaped. At the east end of Great Tower
Street stands All Hallows Barking, so called from
having belonged to the abbey of Barking, Essex. This
narrowly escaped the fire, which burned the dial, and
porch, and vicarage house. Its style is mainly
Perpendicular, with a Decorated east window, and
has some good brasses. St. Andrew's Undershaft,
Leadenhall Street, opposite to which the May-pole was
annually raised until "Evil May-day" put an end to
the merry-makings, was rebuilt in 1520-32, and contains
some mural paintings, much stained glass, and many
brasses and monuments, including that of John Stow,
the famous London antiquary. St. Catherine Cree, in
the same street, was rebuilt in 1629, and consecrated by
Laud. St. Dunstan's-in-the-East was nearly destroyed,
and restored by Wren, the present nave being rebuilt
in 1817. St. Dunstan's, Stepney, preserves its fifteenth
century fabric, and St. Ethelburga's, Bishopsgate,
retains some of its Early English masonry, and St.
Ethelreda's, Ely Place, is the only surviving portion
of the ancient palace of the Bishops of Ely. St. Giles',
Cripplegate, stands near the site of a Saxon church built
in 1090 by Alfun, the first hospitaller of the Priory of
St. Bartholomew. Suffering from a grievous fire in
1545, it was partially rebuilt, and in 1682 the tower
was raised fifteen feet. Many illustrious men were
buried here, including John Fox, John Speed, the
historian, John Milton and his father, several actors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
of the Fortune Theatre, and Sir Martin Frobisher. In
1861 the church was restored in memory of Milton, and
a monument raised to him. This church saw the
nuptials of Oliver Cromwell and Elizabeth Bowchier
in 1620. All Hallows Staining, Mark Lane, escaped the
fire, and its tower and west end are ancient. St. James',
Aldgate, was built in 1622, and escaped the fire, which
might have spared more important edifices; and St.
Olave's, Hart Street, a building which shows Norman,
Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular work, was
happily preserved. This is sometimes called Pepys's
church, since he often mentions it in his diary, and lies
buried here. There are other interesting monuments, and
in the churchyard lie some of the victims of the Great
Plague. St. Sepulchre's, near Newgate, was damaged
by the fire, and refitted by Wren, but the main building
is fifteenth century work. Several churches escaped the
Great Fire, but were subsequently pulled down and
rebuilt. Amongst these are St. Alphege, London Wall;
St. Botolph-without, Aldersgate; St. Botolph's, St.
Martin's Outwich. St. Mary Woolnoth was also
damaged by the fire, and repaired by Wren. It stands
on the site of an early church, which was rebuilt in
the fifteenth century; but the greater part of the present
church was built by Hawksmoor in 1716.</p>

<p>A strange, weird, desolate city met the eyes of the
people of London when the Great Fire had died away.
No words can describe that scene of appalling ruin and
desolation. But, with the energy for which Englishmen
are remarkable, they at once set to work to restore their
loss, and a master-mind was discovered who could
grapple with the difficulty and bring order out of chaos.
This wonderful genius was Sir Christopher Wren. He
devised a grand scheme for the rebuilding of the city.
Evelyn planned another. But property owners were
tenacious of their rights, and clung to their own parcels
of ground; so these great schemes came to nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
However, to Wren fell the task of rebuilding the fallen
churches, and no less than fifty-two were entrusted to
his care. He had no one to guide him; no school of
artists or craftsmen to help him in the detail of his
buildings; no great principles of architecture to direct
him. Gothic architecture was dead, if we except the
afterglow that shone in Oxford. He might have
followed his great predecessor, Inigo Jones, and produced
works after an Italian model. But he was no copyist.
Taking the classic orders as his basis, he devised a style
of his own, suitable for the requirements of the time
and climate, and for the form of worship and religious
usages of the Anglican Church. "It is enough for
Romanists to hear the murmur of the mass, and see the
elevation of the Host; but our churches are to be fitted
for auditories," he once said.</p>

<p>Of the churches built by Wren, eighteen beautiful
buildings have already been destroyed. St. Christopher-le-Stocks
is swallowed up by the Bank of England;
St. Michael, Crooked Lane, disappeared in 1841, when
approaches were made to New London Bridge; St.
Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange made way for the Sun
Fire Office; and St. Benet Fink was pulled down because
of its nearness to the Royal Exchange. Since the
passing of the Union of City Benefices Act in 1860,
fourteen churches designed by Wren have succumbed,
and attacks on others have been with difficulty warded
off.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The characteristics of Wren's genius were his
versatility, imagination, and originality. We will notice
some of the results of these qualities of mind. The
tower hardly ever enters into the architectural treatment
of the interior. It is used as an entrance lobby or
vestry. His simplest plan was a plain oblong, without
columns or recesses, such as St. Mildred's, Bread Street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
or St. Nicholas', Cole Abbey. St. Margaret, Lothbury,
St. Vedast, St. Clement, Eastcheap, have this simple form,
with the addition of an aisle or a recess. His next
plan consists of the central nave and two aisles, with
or without clerestory windows; of this St. Andrew
Wardrobe and St. Magnus the Martyr furnish good
examples. The third plan is the domed church, such
as St. Swithun and St. Mary Abchurch. The merits
and architectural beauties of Wren's churches have been
recently described in an able lecture delivered by
Mr. Arthur Keen before the Architectural Association,
a lecture which we should like to see expanded to the
size of a book, and enriched with copious drawings.
It would be of immense service in directing the minds
of the citizens of London to the architectural treasures
of which they are the heirs.</p>

<p>The churches are remarkable for their beautifully
carved woodwork, often executed or designed by
Grinling Gibbons or his pupils. Pews, pulpits, with
elaborate sounding boards, organ cases, altar pieces,
were all elaborately carved, and a gallery usually was
placed at the west end. Paintings by Sir James
Thornhill and other artists adorn his churches, and
the art of Strong the master mason, Jennings the
carpenter, and Tijou the metal worker, all combined
to beautify his structures.</p>

<p>Within the limits of our space it is only possible
to glance at the interiors of a few of these churches,
and note some of the treasures therein contained.
St. Andrew's, Holborn, has its original fifteenth century
tower, recarved in 1704. It is known as the "Poet's
Church," on account of the singers connected with it,
including a contemporary of Shakespeare, John Webster,
Robert Savage, Chatterton, and Henry Neele, and can
boast of such illustrious rectors as Bishops Hacket and
Stillingfleet, and Dr. Sacheverel. The spire of Christ
Church, Spitalfields, built by Hawksmoor, is the loftiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
in London, and has a fine peal of bells. In the church
there is an early work of Flaxman&mdash;the monument of
Sir Robert Ladbrooke, Lord Mayor. The name of
St. Clement Danes reminds us of the connection of the
sea-rovers with London. Strype says that the church
was so named "because Harold, a Danish King, and
other Danes, were buried there, and in that churchyard."
He tells how this Harold, an illegitimate son of Canute,
reigned three years, and was buried at Westminster;
but, afterwards, Hardicanute, the lawful son of Canute,
in revenge for the injury done to his mother and brother,
ordered the body to be dug up and thrown into the
Thames, where it was found by a fisherman and buried
in this churchyard. There seems to be no doubt that there
was a colony of peaceful Danes in this neighbourhood,
as testified by the Danish word "Wych" given to a street
hard by, and preserved in the modern Aldwych. It was
the oldest suburb of London, the village of Ældwic,
and called Aldewych. Oldwych close was in existence
in the time of the Stuarts. These people were allowed
to reside between the Isle of Thorney, or Westminster,
and Ludgate, and, having become Christians, they built
a church for themselves, which was called <i>Ecclesia
Clementis Danorum</i>.</p>

<p>There is a wild story of the massacre of the Danes
in this church in the days of Ethelred, as recorded in
Strype's <i>Continuation of Stow</i>, and in the <i>Jomsvikinga
Saga</i>. As Mr. Loftie has not found space in <i>Saxon
London</i> to mention this colony of Danes and their
doings, I venture to quote a passage from Mr. Lethaby's
<i>Pre-Conquest London</i>, which contains some interesting
allusions to these people:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We are told that Sweyn made warfare in the land of King Ethelred,
and drove him out of the land; he put <i>Thingumannalid</i> in two places.
The one in Lundunaborg (London) was ruled by Eilif Thorgilsson, who
had sixty ships in the Temps (Thames); the other was north in Sleswik.
The Thingamen made a law that no one should stay away a whole night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
They gathered at the Bura Church every night when a large bell was
rung, but without weapons. He who had command in the town (London)
was Ædric Streona. Ulfkel Snilling ruled over the northern part of
England (East Anglia). The power of the Thingamen was great. There
was a fair there (in London) twice every twelve month, one about midsummer
and the other about midwinter. The English thought it would
be the easiest to slay the Thingamen while Cnut was young (he was ten
winters old) and Sweyn dead. About Yule, waggons went into the
town to the market, and they were all tented over by the treacherous
advice of Ulfkel Snelling and Ethelred's sons. Thord, a man of the
Thingumannalid, went out of the town to the house of his mistress, who
asked him to stay, because the death was planned of all the Thingamen
by Englishmen concealed in the waggons, when the Danes would go
unarmed to the church. Thord went into the town and told it to Eilif.
They heard the bell ringing, and when they came to the churchyard
there was a great crowd who attacked them. Eilif escaped with three
ships and went to Denmark. Some time after, Edmund was made King.
After three winters, Cnut, Thorkel and Eric went with eight hundred
ships to England. Thorkel had thirty ships, and slew Ulfkel Snilling,
and married Ulfhild, his wife, daughter of King Ethelred. With Ulfkel
was slain every man on sixty ships, and Cnut took Lundunaborg."</p></div>

<p>Matthew, of Westminster, also records this massacre
of the Danes, and other authorities consider that the
account in the <i>Saga</i> is founded on fact. However that
may be, the Danes undoubtedly had a colony here of
their traders, merchants, and seamen, and dedicated their
church to their favourite saint, St. Clement, the patron
of mariners, whose constant emblem is an anchor. Nor
was this the only location of the Northmen. Southwark
was their fortified trading place, where they had a church
dedicated to St. Olaf, the patron saint of Norway. His
name remains in Tooley Street, not a very evident but
certainly true derivative of St. Olaf's Street. There are
three churches dedicated to St. Olave, who was none
other than St. Olaf. St. Magnus, too, tells of the
Northmen, who was one of their favourite saints. Going
back to the church of St. Clement Danes, we notice that
it was rebuilt in 1682 under the advice of Wren, the
tower and steeple being added forty years later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
Dr. Johnson used to attend here, and a pillar near his
seat bears the inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In this pew and beside this pillar, for many years attended Divine
Service, the celebrated Dr. Johnson, the philosopher, the poet, the great
lexicographer, the profound moralist, and chief writer of his time. Born
1709, died 1794. In remembrance and honour of noble faculties, nobly
employed, some inhabitants of the parish of St. Clement Danes have
placed this slight memorial, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1851."</p></div>

<p>One of the most important city churches is St. Mary-le-Bow,
Cheapside. It is one of Wren's finest works;
but the old church, destroyed by the Great Fire, had a
notable history, being one of the earliest Norman
buildings in the country. Stow says it was named
St. Mary <i>de Arcubus</i> from its being built on arches of
stone, these arches forming a crypt, which still exists.
The tower was a place of sanctuary, but not a very
effectual one, as Longbeard, a ringleader of a riot, was
forced out of his refuge by fire in 1190, and Ducket,
a goldsmith, was murdered. The Bow bells are famous,
and one of them was rung nightly for the closing of
shops. Everyone knows the protesting rhyme of the
'prentices of the Cheap when the clerk rang the bell
late, and the reassuring reply of that officer, who
probably feared the blows of their staves. Lanterns
hung in the arches of the spire as beacons for travellers.
The bells of Bow are said to have recalled Dick
Whittington, and those who have always lived in the
district where their sound can be heard are
deemed very ignorant folk by their country cousins.
Whittington's church was St. Michael's Paternoster
Royal, Thames Street, which he rebuilt, and wherein he
was buried, though his body has been twice disturbed.
The church was destroyed by the Great Fire, and rebuilt
by Wren.</p>

<p>It is impossible for us to visit all the churches, each
of which possesses some feature of interest, some
historical association. They impart much beauty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
every view of the city, and not one of them can be
spared. Sometimes, in this utilitarian age, wise men
tell us that we should pull down many of these ancient
buildings, sell the valuable sites, and build other churches
in the suburbs, where they would be more useful.
Eighteen of Wren's churches have been thus destroyed,
besides several of later date. The city merchants of
old built their churches, and made great sacrifices in
doing so, for the honour of God and the good of their
fellow-men, and it is not for their descendants to pull
them down. If suburban people want churches, they
should imitate the example of their forefathers, and
make sacrifices in order to build them. Streets, old
palaces, interesting houses, are fast vanishing; the
churches&mdash;at least, some of them&mdash;remain to tell the
story of the ancient civic life, to point the way to
higher things amid the bustling scenes of mercantile
activity and commercial unrest. The readers of these
Memorials will wish "strength i' th' arme" to the City
Churches Preservation Society to do battle for these
historic landmarks of ancient London.</p>


<h3>The Pageant of the Streets</h3>

<p>Nothing helps us to realise the condition of ancient
London, its growth and expansion, like a careful study
of its street-names. It shows that in the Middle Ages
London was very different from that great, overcrowded,
noisy, and far-extending metropolis which we see to-day.
It is difficult for us in these days to realise the small
extent of ancient London, when Charing was a village
situated between the cities of Westminster and London;
or, indeed, to go back in imagination even a century
or two ago, when the citizens could go a-nutting on
Notting Hill, and when it was possible to see Temple
Bar from Leicester Square, then called Leicester Fields,
and with a telescope observe the heads of the Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
rebels which adorned the spikes of the old gateway.
In the early coaching days, on account of the impassable
roads, it required three hours to journey from Paddington
to the city. Kensington, Islington, Brompton, and
Paddington were simply country villages, separated by
fields and pastures from London; and the names of
such districts as Spitalfields, Bethnal Green, Smithfield,
Moorfields, and many others, now crowded with houses,
indicate the once rural character of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The area enclosed by the city walls was not larger than
Hyde Park. Their course has been already traced, but we
can follow them on the map of London by means of the
names of the streets. Thus, beginning at the Tower, we
pass on to Aldgate, and then to Bishopsgate. Outside was
a protecting moat, which survives in the name Houndsditch,
wherein doubtless dead dogs found a resting
place. Then we pass on to London Wall, a street which
sufficiently tells its derivation. Outside this part of the
wall there was a fen, or bog, or moor, which survives
in Moorfields, Moorgate Street, and possibly Finsbury;
and Artillery Street shows where the makers of bows
and arrows had their shops, near the artillery ground,
where the users of these weapons practised at the butts.
The name of the Barbican tells of a tower that guarded
Aldersgate, and some remains of the wall can still be
seen in Castle Street and in the churchyard of St. Giles',
Cripplegate, the derivation of which has at length been
satisfactorily determined by Mr. Loftie in our first
chapter, and has nothing to do with the multitude of
cripples which Stow imagined congregated there. Thence
we go to Newgate and the Old Bailey, names that tell
of walls and fortifications. Everyone knows the name
of the Bailey court of a castle, which intervened between
the keep or stronger portion of the defences and the
outer walls or gate. The court of the Old Bailey
suggests to modern prisoners other less pleasing ideas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
Now the wall turns southward, in the direction of
Ludgate, where it was protected by a stream called
the Fleet, whence the name Fleet Street is derived.
Canon Isaac Taylor suggests that Fleet Street is really
Flood Street, from which Ludgate or Floodgate takes
its name. We prefer the derivation given by Mr. Loftie.
On the south of Ludgate, and on the bank of the
Thames, stood a mighty strong castle, called Baynard
Castle, constructed by William the Conqueror to aid
him, with the Tower of London, to keep the citizens
in order. It has entirely disappeared, but if you look
closely at the map you will find a wharf which records
its memory, and a ward of the city also is named after
the long vanished stronghold. Now the course of the
wall follows the north bank of the river Thames, and
the names Dowgate and Billingsgate record its memory
and of the city gates, which allowed peaceable citizens
to enter, but were strong to resist foes and rebels.</p>

<p>Within these walls craftsmen and traders had their
own particular localities, the members of each trade
working together side by side in their own street or
district; and although now some of the trades have
disappeared, and traders are no longer confined to one
district, the street-names record the ancient home of
their industries. The two great markets were the
Eastcheap and Westcheap, now Cheapside. The former,
in the days of Lydgate, was the abode of the butchers.
Martin Lyckpenny sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then I hyed me into Est-chepe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One cryes ribbes of befe and many a pye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And near the butchers naturally were the cooks, who
flourished in Cooks' Row, along Thames Street.
Candlewick Street took its name from the chandlers.
Cornhill marks the site of the ancient corn market.
Haymarket, where the theatre is so well known, was
the site of a market for hay, but that is comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
modern. The citizens did not go so far out of the
city to buy and sell hay. Stow says: "Then higher
in Grasse Street is that parish church of St. Bennet,
called Grasse Church, of the herb market there kept";
and though he thinks Fenchurch Street may be derived
from a fenny or moorish ground, "others be of opinion
that it took that name of <i>Fænum</i>, that is, hay sold there,
as Grasse Street took the name of grass, or herbs, there
sold." Wool was sold near the church of St. Mary
Woolchurch, which stood on the site of the present
Mansion House, and in the churchyard was a beam for
the weighing of wool. The name survives in that of
St. Mary Woolnoth, with which parish the other was
united when St. Mary Woolchurch was destroyed by
the Great Fire. Lombard Street marks the settlement
of the great Lombardi merchants, the Italian financiers,
bankers, and pawnbrokers, who found a convenient
centre for their transactions midway between the two
great markets, Eastcheap and Cheapside. Sometimes
the name of the street has been altered in course of
time, so that it is difficult to determine the original
meaning. Thus Sermon Lane has nothing to do with
parsons, but is a corruption of Sheremoniers' Lane, who
"cut and rounded the plates to be coined and stamped
into sterling pence," as Stow says. Near this lane was
the Old Exchange, where money was coined. Later on,
this coining was done at a place still called the mint,
in Bermondsey. Stow thought that Lothbury was so
called because it was a loathsome place, on account of
the noise made by the founders; but it is really a
corruption of Lattenbury, the place where these founders
"cast candlesticks, chafing-dishes, spice mortars, and
such like copper or laton works." Of course, people
sold their fowls in the Poultry; fish and milk and bread
shops were to be found in the streets bearing these names;
and leather in Leather Lane and, perhaps, Leadenhall
Market, said to be a corruption of Leatherhall, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Stow does not give any hint of this. Sopers' Lane
was the abode of the soapmakers; Smithfield of the
smiths. Coleman Street derives its name from the man
who first built and owned it, says Stow; but later
authorities place there the coalmen or charcoal-burners.
As was usual in mediæval towns, the Jews had a district
for themselves, and resided in Old Jewry and Jewin
Street.</p>

<p>The favourite haunt of booksellers and publishers,
Paternoster Row, derives its name, according to Stow,
"from the stationers or text-writers that dwelled there,
who wrote and sold all sorts of books then in use, namely,
A. B. C. or Absies, with the Paternoster, Ave, Creed,
Graces, etc. There dwelled also turners of beads, and
they are called Paternoster-makers. At the end of
Paternoster Row is Ave Mary Lane, so called upon the
like occasion of text-writers and bead-makers then
dwelling there." Creed Lane and Amen Corner make
up the names of these streets where the worshippers in
Old St. Paul's found their helps to devotion.</p>

<p>Old London was a city of palaces as well as of
trade. All the great nobles of England had their town
houses, or inns, as they were called. They had vast
retinues of armed men, and required no small lodging.
The Dukes of Exeter and Somerset, the Earl of
Northumberland, and many others, had their town
houses, every vestige of which has passed away, though
their names are preserved by the streets and sites on
which they stood. The Strand, for example, is full of
the memories of these old mansions, which began to
be erected along the river bank when the Wars of the
Roses had ceased, and greater security was felt by the
people of England, who then began to perceive that
it might be possible to live in safety outside the walls
of the city. Northumberland Avenue tells of the house
of the Earls of Northumberland, which stood so late
as 1875; Burleigh Street and Essex Street recall the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
famous Sir William Cecil, Lord Burleigh, whose son
was created Earl of Essex. Arundel House, the mansion
of the Howards, is marked by Arundel Street, Surrey
Street, Howard Street, Norfolk Street, these being the
titles borne by scions of this famous family. The
readers of the chapter on the Royal Palaces need not
be told of the traditions preserved by the names
Somerset House and the Savoy. Cecil Street and
Salisbury Street recall the memory of Salisbury House,
built by Sir Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, brother of
the Earl of Essex mentioned above. Then we have
Bedford Street, with Russell Street, Southampton Street,
Tavistock Street, around Covent Garden. These
names unfold historical truths. Covent Garden is an
abbreviated form of Convent Garden, the garden of the
monks of Westminster. It was granted to the Russell
family at the dissolution of monasteries, and the Russells,
Earls of Bedford, erected a mansion here, which has
long disappeared, but has left traces behind in the
streets named after the various titles to which members
of the Russell family attained. In another part of
London we find traces of the same family. After
leaving Covent Garden they migrated to Bloomsbury,
and there we find Bedford Square, Southampton Street,
Russell Square, Tavistock Square, and Chenies Street,
this latter being named after their seat in Buckinghamshire.
Craven buildings, near Drury Lane, tells of the
home of Lord Craven, the devoted admirer of the
"Queen of Hearts," the beautiful Queen of Bohemia.
Clare House, the mansion of the Earls of Clare, survives
in Clare Market; and Leicester Square points to the
residence of the favourite of Queen Elizabeth, and
Villiers Street and Buckingham Street to that of another
court favourite, the Duke of Buckingham. The bishops
also had their town houses, and their sites are recorded
by such names as Ely Place, Salisbury Square, Bangor
Court, and Durham Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span></p>

<p>We might wander westward, and trace the progress
of building and of fashion, and mark the streets that
bear witness to the memories of great names in English
history; but that would take us far beyond our limits.
Going back citywards, we should find many other
suggestive names of streets&mdash;those named after churches;
those that record the memories of religious houses, such
as Blackfriars, Austin Friars, Crutched Friars; those
that mark the course of many streams and brooks that
now find their way underground to the great river.
All these names recall glimpses of Old London, and
must be cherished as priceless memorials of ancient days.</p>


<h3>The Heart of the City</h3>

<p>In the centre of London, at the eastern end of
Cheapside, stand the Royal Exchange, the Mansion
House, and Bank of England, all of which merit
attention. The official residence of the Lord Mayor&mdash;associated
with the magnificent hospitality of the city,
with the memory of many distinguished men who have
held the office of Chief Magistrate, and with the
innumerable charitable schemes which have been initiated
there&mdash;was built by Dance, and completed in 1753. It
is in the Italian style, and resembles a Palladian
Palace. Its conspicuous front, with Corinthian columns
supporting a pediment, in the centre of which is a
group of allegorical sculpture, is well known to all
frequenters of the city. Formerly it had an open
court, but this has been roofed over and converted into
a grand banquetting hall, known as the Egyptian Hall.
There are other dining rooms, a ball room, and drawing
room, all superbly decorated, and the Mansion House
is a worthy home for the Lord Mayor of London.</p>

<p>The Bank of England commenced its career in 1691;
founded by William Paterson, a Scotsman, and
incorporated by William III. The greatest monetary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
establishment in the world at first managed to contain
its wealth in a single chest, not much larger than a
seaman's box. Its first governor was Sir John Houblon,
who appears largely in the recent interesting volume on
the records of the Houblon family, and whose house
and garden were on part of the site of the present
bank. The halls of the mercers and grocers provided
a home for the officials in their early dealings. The
site of the bank was occupied by a church, St.
Christopher-le-Stocks, three taverns, and several houses.
These have all been removed to make room for the
extensions which from time to time were found necessary.
The back of the Threadneedle Street front is the
earliest portion&mdash;built in 1734, to which Sir Robert
Taylor added two wings; and then Sir John Soane
was appointed architect, and constructed the remainder
of the present buildings in the Corinthian style, after
the model of the Temple of the Sibyl at Tivoli. There
have been several subsequent additions, including the
heightening of the Cornhill front by an attic in 1850.
There have been many exciting scenes without those
sombre-looking walls. It has been attacked by rioters.
Panics have created "runs" on the bank; in 1745 the
managers just saved themselves by telling their agents
to demand payment for large sums in sixpences, which
took a long time to count, the agents then paying in
the sixpences, which had to be again counted, and
thus preventing <i>bonâ-fide</i> holders of notes presenting
them. At one time the corporation had a very
insignificant amount of money in the bank, and just
saved themselves by issuing one pound notes. The
history of forgeries on the bank would make an
interesting chapter, and the story of its defence in the
riots of 1780, when old inkstands were used as bullets by
the gallant defenders, fills a page of old-world romance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image_041.jpg" width="600" height="354" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class='center'><span class="smcap">The Royal Exchange.</span></p>

<p class='center'><i>Engraved by Hollar, 1644.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>But interesting as these buildings are, their stories
pale before that of the Royal Exchange. The present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
building was finished in 1844, and opened by her late
Majesty Queen Victoria with a splendid state and civic
function. Its architecture is something after the style
of the Pantheon at Rome. Why the architects of that
and earlier periods always chose Italian models for
their structures is one of the mysteries of human error;
but, as we have seen, all these three main buildings in
the heart of the city are copied from Italian structures.
William Tite was the architect, and he achieved no
mean success. The great size of the portico, the vastness
of the columns, the frieze and sculptured tympanum,
and striking figures, all combine to make it an imposing
building. Upon the pedestal of the figure of
"Commerce" is the inscription: "The earth is the
Lord's, and the fulness thereof." The interior has been
enriched by a series of mural paintings, representing
scenes from the municipal life of London, the work of
eminent artists.</p>

<p>This exchange is the third which has stood upon
this site. The first was built by Sir Thomas Gresham,
one of the famous family of merchants to whom
London owes many benefits. It was a "goodly Burse,"
of Flemish design, having been built by a Flemish
architect and Flemish workmen, and closely resembled
the great Burse of Antwerp. The illustration, taken
from an old engraving by Hollar, 1644, shows the
building with its large court, with an arcade, a corridor
or "pawn" of stalls above, and, in the high-pitched
roof, chambers with dormer windows. Above the roofs
a high bell-tower is seen, from which, at twelve o'clock
at noon and at six in the evening, a bell sounded forth
that proclaimed the call to 'Change. The merchants
are shown walking or sitting on the benches transacting
their business. Each nationality or trade had its own
"walk." Thus there were the "Scotch walk," "Hanbro',"
"Irish," "East country," "Swedish," "Norway,"
"American," "Jamaica," "Spanish," "Portugal,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
"French," "Greek," and "Dutch and Jewellers'" walks.
When Queen Elizabeth came to open the Exchange, the
tradesmen began to use the hundred shops in the
corridor, and "milliners or haberdashers sold mouse-traps,
bird-cages, shoeing-horns, Jews' trumps, etc.;
armourers, that sold both old and new armour;
apothecaries, booksellers, goldsmiths, and glass-sellers."
The Queen declared that this beautiful building should
be no longer called the Burse, but gave it the name
"The Royal Exchange." In the illustration some
naughty boys have trespassed upon the seclusion of
the busy merchants, and the beadle is endeavouring to
drive them out of the quadrangle.</p>

<p>This fine building was destroyed by the Great Fire,
when all the statues fell down save that of the founder,
Sir Thomas Gresham. His trustees, now known as the
Gresham Committee, set to work to rebuild it, and
employed Edward German as their architect, though
Wren gave advice concerning the project. As usual,
the citizens were not very long in accomplishing their task,
and three years after the fire the second Exchange was
opened, and resembled in plan its predecessor. Many
views of it appear in the Crace collection in the British
Museum. In 1838 it was entirely destroyed by fire. In
the clock-tower there was a set of chimes, and the
last tune they played, appropriately, was, "There's nae
luck about the house." As we have seen, in a few years
the present Royal Exchange arose, which we trust will
be more fortunate than its predecessors, and never fall
a victim to the flames.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is much else that we should like to see in
Old London, and record in these Memorials. We should
like to visit the old fairs, especially Bartholomew Fair,
Smithfield, either in the days of the monks or with
my Lady Castlemaine, who came in her coach, and
mightily enjoyed a puppet show; and the wild beasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
dwarfs, operas, tight-rope dancing, sarabands, dogs
dancing the Morrice, hare beating a tabor, a tiger
pulling the feathers from live fowls, the humours of
Punchinello, and drolls of every degree. Pages might
be written of the celebrities of the fair, of the puppet
shows, where you could see such incomparable dramas
as <i>Whittington and his Cat</i>, <i>Dr. Faustus</i>, <i>Friar Bacon</i>,
<i>Robin Hood and Little John</i>, <i>Mother Shipton</i>, together
with "the tuneful warbling pig of Italian race." But
our pageant is passing, and little space remains. We
should like to visit the old prisons. A friend of the
writer, Mr. Milliken, has allowed himself to be locked
in all the ancient gaols which have remained to our
time, and taken sketches of all the cells wherein famous
prisoners have been confined; of gates, and bars, and bolts
and doors, which have once restrained nefarious gaol-birds.
Terrible places they were, these prisons, wherein
prisoners were fleeced and robbed by governors and
turnkeys, and, if they had no money, were kicked and
buffeted in the most merciless manner. Old Newgate,
which has just disappeared, has perhaps the most
interesting history. It began its career as a prison in
the form of a tower or part of the city gate. Thus
it continued until the Great Fire, after which it was
restored by Wren. In our illustration of the old
gatehouse, it will be seen that it had a windmill at
the top. This was an early attempt at ventilation, in
order to overcome the dread malady called "gaol
distemper," which destroyed many prisoners. Many
notable names appear on the list of those who suffered
here, including several literary victims, whose writings
caused them grievous sufferings. The prison so lately
destroyed was designed by George Dance in 1770.
A recent work on architecture describes it as almost
perfect of its kind. Before it was completed it was
attacked by the Gordon rioters, who released the
prisoners and set it on fire. It was repaired and finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
in 1782. Outwardly so imposing, inwardly it was, for
a long period, one of the worst prisons in London, full
of vice and villainy, unchecked, unreformed; while
outside frequently gathered tumultuous crowds to see
the condemned prisoners hanged. We might have
visited also the debtors' prisons with Mr. Pickwick and
other notables, if our minds were not surfeited with
prison fare; and even followed the hangman's cart
to Tyburn, to see the last of some notorious criminals.
Where the Ludgate Railway Station now stands was
the famous Fleet prison, which had peculiar privileges,
the Liberty of the Fleet allowing prisoners to go on
bail and lodge in the neighbourhood of the prison.
The district extended from the entrance to St. Paul's
churchyard, Old Bailey, Ludgate Hill, to the Thames.
Everyone has heard of the Fleet marriages that took
place in this curious neighbourhood. On the other side
of New Bridge Street there was a wild district called
Alsatia, extending from Fleet Street to the Thames,
wherein, until 1697, cheats and scoundrels found a safe
sanctuary, and could not be disturbed.</p>

<p>Again, we should like to visit the old public gardens,
Vauxhall and Ranelagh, in company with Horace
Walpole, or with Miss Burney's <i>Evelina</i> or Fielding's
<i>Amelia</i>, and note "the extreme beauty and elegance of
the place, with its 1,000 lamps"; "and happy is it for
me," the young lady remarks, "since to give an adequate
idea of it would exceed my power of description."</p>

<p>But the pageant must at length pass on, and we
must wake from the dreams of the past to find ourselves
in our ever growing, ever changing, modern London.
It is sufficient for us to reflect sometimes on the past
life of the great city, to see again the scenes which
took place in the streets and lanes we know so well,
to form some ideas of the characters and manners of
our forefathers, and to gather together some memorials
of the greatest and most important city in the world.</p>

Exchange as it was in 1607, when "at every turn a man is put in mind of
Babel, there is such a confusion of languages"; and as late as 1644 the
picturesque dresses of the foreign merchants appear in an engraving by
Hollar.</p></div>

spacious, high-built, and goodly to be seene by reason of the huge Pillars and
a right beautiful arched Roof of stone."</p></div>
